\section{Introduction}
\todo{To do.  To-do items are coded in red.}
The central region of our Galaxy is the nearest location in which we can study
star formation in an `extreme' environment.  While there have been great leaps
in our understanding of low-mass star formation from local molecular clouds in
the past decade \citep{}, there remain many unanswered questions about how star
formation changes as gas becomes denser, more opaque, and more turbulent, as it
most likely was in galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation.


The Galactic Center:

The \citet{Molinari2011a} ring has attracted a great deal of attention
recently, as it has the most gas in the CMZ and a large, but unrealized,
star-forming potential
\citep{Longmore2013a,Longmore2012b,Longmore2012a,Kruijssen2013a,Yusef-Zadeh2009a,Immer2012a}.
The star formation in this region is suppressed relative to expectations based
on nearby star-forming regions and nearby (on a different scale) Galactic
disks.  Hypotheses for this depressed star formation rate include suppressed
fragmentation by cosmic ray and X-ray heating and a raised star formation
threshold from enhanced turbulence.



\section{Observations \& Data Reduction}

\subsection{Observations}
We observed the Central Molecular Zone from $-0.4 < \ell < 1.6$ with the SHFI-1
instrument \citep{Vassilev2008a} on the APEX telescope using the XFFTS backend.
The observations were divided into 25 hours in June 2013 and 75 hours in
April-July 2014.  \todo{Add more dates and times here.}

The 2013 observations were taken in $4\arcmin \times 4\arcmin$ patches, and the
frequency range covered was 217.5-220 GHz and 216-218.5 GHz in the two spectral
windows.  Scans were performed along lines of constant RA and Dec.

The 2014 observing strategy was modified to use larger $8\arcmin \times
8\arcmin$ scans along lines of Galactic latitude and longitude.  The frequency
range was also shifted to cover windows over 217-219.5 and 218.4-220.9 GHz, thus
including the bright \thirteenco and \ceighteeno 2-1 lines.

The raw data were acquired with 32768 spectral channels in each window, yielding
0.1 \kms resolution.  We downsampled the data by a factor of 8 to 0.8 \kms
resolution to make the data more manageable.  We also expect to see no lines
narrower than a few \kms in the CMZ, particularly not with the relatively
shallow observations we have acquired.

\todo{Mention typical/min/max system temperatures.}

\subsection{Reduction}
\subsubsection{Calibration}
Calibration was performed at the telescope using the standard APEX calibration
tools
\footnote{See the observing manuals:
\url{www.apex-telescope.org/documents/public/APEX-MPI-MAN-0012.pdf}
\url{www.apex-telescope.org/documents/public/APEX-MPI-MAN-0013.pdf} }.
These yield flux-calibrated spectra at each position with appropriate pointing
information.  \todo{Typical flux calibration uncertainties are $\sim10\%$ and
pointing errors $\sigma\lesssim2$\arcsec.} % ask carlos about this

There was a significant calibration error discovered at the APEX telescope during
a large segment of the 2014 observing campaign
(\url{http://www.apex-telescope.org/heterodyne/shfi/calibration/calfactor/}).
The calibration errors were of order $\sim15-25\%$.  They were corrected after
the fact, but the remaining calibration uncertainty
is higher in this data, $\sim15\%$ total rather than the usual $\sim10\%$.

\subsubsection{Flagging bad spectra}
Spectra were removed if they showed excessive noise compared to the
theoretical expectation given the measured system temperature.  As in
\citet{Ao2013a}, the threshold was set to $1.5\times$ the theoretical noise,
i.e. $1.5 \sqrt{2} T_{sys} (\Delta\nu t_{exp})^0.5$, where $t_{exp}$ is the
exposure time (integration time) per spectrum in seconds and $\Delta\nu$ is the
channel width in Hz.  This approach resulted in $\sim0.2\%$ of the data being
removed.  

At the position of Sgr B2, the noise was significantly higher due to signal
from the continuum source.  We therefore disabled this flagging in a
$\sim2.5\arcmin$ box around Sgr B2.


% Removing these baselines by
% the usual technique of masking out the emitting spectral region and fitting a
% low-order polynomial to the surroundings is somewhat impractical in the
% Galactic Center, where baseline ripples are on comparable scales to the
% extremely wide spectral lines.

%This method was abandoned: it resulted in negative bowls
% We perform a scan-by-scan baseline subtraction as follows: 
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Compute the mean spectrum across the scan
%     \item Identify pixels $>1-\sigma$ above the mean spectrum to be ignored
%         when baseline fitting (this is a simple `line masking' process)
%     \item Fit a line to each spectral channel across the scan
%     \item Smooth the fitted line parameters with a gaussian with with
%         $\sigma=10$ channels, interpolating into the line-masked regions
%     \item Subtract the fitted baselines
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% We therefore adopted a principle component analysis (PCA) baseline removal
% approach in which the data were spectrally smoothed and downsampled by an
% additional factor of 25, for a characteristic frequency scale of 15 MHz.  The
% data had their means subtracted before PCA cleaning so that only time-variable
% baseline variation was removed.  The resulting data were decomposed into
% eigenspectra, of which the 3 most correlated components were then set to zero.
% These components visually match the baseline ripples, and due to the wide
% smoothing (20 \kms resolution), no line information is lost.  The selection of
% 3 components was determined empirically by examining the eigenspectra; a test
% removing the first 10 components showed no significant difference in the
% cleaning but did show signs of extracting large-scale correlated signal.
%

% show the baselines that are removed by PCA cleaning.  They do not include any
% signal from the spectral lines.  \todo{This will be
% replaced with a higher-quality figure}}
% {fig:eigenspectra}{0.5}{0}


\subsubsection{Mapmaking}
The maps were made by computing an output grid in Galactic coordinates with
7.2\arcsec pixels and adding each spectrum to the appropriate pixel\footnote{We
use the term `pixel' to refer to a square data element projected on the sky
with axes in Galactic coordinates.  The term `voxel' is used to indicate a cubic data
element, with two axes in galactic coordinates and a third in frequency or
velocity}.  In order
to avoid empty pixels and maximize the signal-to-noise, the spectra were added
to the grid with a weight set from a gaussian with $FWHM=10\arcsec$, which
effectively smooths the output images from $FWHM\approx28\arcsec$ to
$\approx30\arcsec$.  See \citet{Mangum2007a} for more detail on the on-the-fly
mapping technique used here.

%\todo{To demonstrate the utility of the PCA subtraction approach described in Section
%\ref{sec:baseline}, we show maps of the \formaldehyde \threeohthree line before
%and after PCA subtraction.}

The PPV cubes were created with units of brightness temperature ($T_A^*$).  The
main beam efficiency is $\eta_{mb} = 0.75$ (gain $\sim39$
Jy/K)\footnote{\url{http://www.apex-telescope.org/telescope/efficiency/}}.



\subsection{Baselining}
\label{sec:baseline}
The data showed significant baseline structure, leading to large-scale
correlated components in the resulting spectra.  The baselines were removed
after cube generation by first identifying bright regions in the \para
\threeohthree line using the technique described in Section \ref{sec:signal},
masking those out for each other line, then fitting a 7th-order polynomial to
the remaining spectra over the velocity range -150 to 250 \kms and subtracting
it.  Lower order baseline removal left a significant and patterned residual.
After performing this baselining, the signal was re-extracted using the same
method.

\section{Signal Extraction \& Analysis}
\label{sec:signal}
We use the method described partially in \citet{Ao2013a} and more thoroughly in
\citet{Dame2011b} to mask the data cubes at locations of significant signal in 
the brightest line. 
A noise map was created by computing the sample standard deviation over a
200 \kms range in which no signal was present.
We use the \para \threeohthree line to create the mask by
the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Smooth the data with a gaussian of width 2 pixels in each direction
        (spatial and spectral)
    \item Identify all pixels with brightness $T_A > 3\sigma$ in the smoothed
        map
    \item Grow the mask from the previous step by 1 pixel in each direction
        (this is known in image processing as binary dilation)
\end{enumerate}

The \para \threeohthree mask was then applied to the \threetwoone and
\threetwotwo cubes created with the same PPV gridding.  There is some overlap
between the \methanol \fourtwotwo line and the \para \threetwotwo line in PPV
space, so we shifted the \para mask to the velocity of the \methanol line in
the \para \threetwotwo cube and excluded all pixels with \para detections.

\subsection{Ratio and Temperature Maps}
\label{sec:h2co}
We created two independent ratio maps, \threetwotwo/\threeohthree and
\threetwoone/\threeohthree, so that the two ratios (which are expected to be
nearly the same) can be used as a sanity check.  However, in many regions,
especially those with the greatest signal, the \threetwotwo line is strongly
affected by contamination from a \methanol line, so the ratio is not
particularly reliable.

Ratio maps are subject to dramatic uncertainties in the low signal-to-noise
regime, which is inevitably reached in some parts of the map.  The error
distribution on the ratio becomes non-Gaussian as signal approaches zero,
approaching a pathological Cauchy distribution in which the mean becomes
undefined as the mean of the individual values being compared approaches zero.
We therefore limited our ratio measurements to regions with significance
$>5\sigma$ in the \threeohthree line and used that line as the denominator
in the ratio.  By using the brighter line as the denominator, we avoid
divide-by-zero numerical errors.

absorption and therefore are not reliable.  Higher ratios (red) correspond
to higher temperatures.

\subsection{Region Extraction}
In order to extract higher signal-to-noise measurements on selected regions, we
broke the data down into subsets using both a by-eye region selection drawing
regions using ds9 and a more systematic approach using a dendrogram-based clump
finding algorithm \citep[][\url{http://dendrograms.org/}]{Rosolowsky2008c}.

% dendro_temperature.py
% TODO: decide whether we used the full resolution or the smoothed version.
% Presently (Jan 5), we are using the smoothed version
We ran the dendrogram/clumpfind extraction analysis on the smoothed
\threeohthree cube data.  We enforced thresholds of a minimum number of pixels
$N_{min}=100$, a peak threshold of $I = 3\sigma$, and a splitting threshold
$\Delta = 2\sigma$.  The exact values of these parameters is not particularly
important, as we are interested in general trends with size-scale and
galactocentric distance, but we caution against overinterpretation of the
resulting catalog as the number of sources and their size and distribution can
change dramatically with small changes in the selected parameters.  The number
and location of pixels included in the catalog is, however, relatively robust
against small parameter changes.

For each extracted blob, we measured the corresponding integrated and peak
emission in the \threetwoone and \thirteenco cubes.  We also extracted the mean
dust temperature and column density from SED fits to Herschel HiGal 170-500\um
maps.  The SED fits were performed on background-subtracted data using an
approach originally described in \citet{Battersby2011a}, which includes details
of the fitting process and specification of assumed physical parameters.  We
also extracted dust column density and temperature using a more naive
pixel-by-pixel approach with no background subtraction
(\url{http://hi-gal-sed-fitter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/}) and found the two
to be consistent.

The by-eye selected regions were extracted less systematically, instead
focusing on peaks in the \threeohthree or \threetwoone emission.  We also
included a series of large square $8\arcmin \times 8\arcmin$ `apertures'
corresponding to each observed field.  For each region extracted in this
fashion, we fit a 1-3 component model as described in Section
\ref{sec:linemodeling}.  An example spectrum extracted from a small region
around ``cloud d'' is shown in Figure \ref{fig:clouddspec}.


\subsection{Line Modeling}
\label{sec:linemodeling}
\todo{Different grids have been used at different stages.  The specific numbers
will need to be updated.}
We use RADEX \citet{van-Der-Tak2007a} to create a model grid for the
p-\formaldehyde lines over a sparse grid of density ($n=10^{4,5,6,7}$ \percc),
a fixed assumed line gradient of 5 \kms / pc, a fixed column of \formaldehyde
$N(\formaldehyde) = 9.5\ee{13}$ \persc (which corresponds to an abundance
$X=10^{-8.5}$ at $N(\hh) = 3\ee{22}$ \persc, and a range of temperatures from
10 to 300 K with 100 evenly spaced grid points.  The grid was created using
the \texttt{pyradex} wrapper of
RADEX\footnote{\url{https://github.com/keflavich/pyradex}}.
We then upsampled these grids by spline interpolating between grid points to
acquire a high-resolution ($T\times n \times N = 250\times100\times100$) grid
covering $10<T<350$ K, $10^{2.5} < n < 10^7$ \percc, and $10^{11} < N <
10^{15.1}$ \persc\perkmspc.

We extracted spectra averaged over each `by-eye' selected region and fitted
a 6-parameter model to the full 218-219 GHz spectral range.  The fitted
parameters are the amplitude of the \formaldehyde \threeohthree line, the
centroid velocity, the line width ($\sigma$, not FWHM), the ratio $R_1 =
\Rone$, the ratio $R_2 = \Rtwo$, and the amplitude of the \methanol \fourtwotwo
line.


For each extracted region, we created $\chi^2$ grids using independent
constraints from the line ratio, the \formaldehyde abundance, and the total
column density of \hh.  We use the line \emph{ratio} rather than line
brightnesses to avoid uncertainties due to the ``filling factor'' of the
emitting gas: even for diffuse clouds, the filling factor of the emitting
regions may be $ff<<1$ if the emission is isolated to compact shocked regions,
as expected if highly supersonic $\mathcal{M}>10$ turbulence is energetically
dominant in the clouds.  We use an abundance $N(\para)/N(\hh) = X(\para) =
10^{9.08\pm1} = 1.2\ee{9} \times/\div 10$, allowing for dramatic uncertainty in
the \formaldehyde abundance
\citep{Ginsburg2013a,Carey1998a,Wootten1978a,Mundy1987a}.  To constrain the
total column density, we use the Herschel dust maps to derive an \hh column
density, which has a nominal $\sim2-3\times$ uncertainty.  We treat the error
as $10\times$ to account for the abundance uncertainty.  This large assumed
error also accounts for factor $\sim2-3$ uncertainty due to line-of-sight
confusion, since the dust column density cannot be associated with any specific
velocity component.

These constraints are shown projected onto the three planes of our fitted
parameter space in the multi-paneled Figures
\ref{fig:coltemconstraints}-\ref{fig:parsonbrightness}.  The fitted parameters
are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:parsonbrightness}.

While $R_2$ can, in some cases, provide significant constraints on various
parameters, we do not use it because of the ambiguity imposed by the overlap
with the \methanol \fourtwotwo line.

the \methanol \fourtwotwo line.  }

\subsection{Blob modeling}
\label{sec:dendromod}
Similar to the line modeling approach, we derived temperatures for each
dendrogram catalog blob using the measured line ratio and dust column density.
The $\chi^2$ grid approach described in Section \ref{sec:linemodeling} was used
to extract the temperature and associated error.

We plot the derived temperature for all clumps against the measured line ratio
in Figure \ref{fig:ratiovstem}.  The relation is nearly monotonic for the vast
majority of sources.  To simplify further analysis, we fit a three-element
piecewise linear model for temperature as a function of $R_1$.  We use this
function for further derivations of the temperature.  There is noticeable
scatter above $R_1 > 0.4$ and $T>150$ K, but in this regime the modeling is
already intrinsically uncertain and these ratios are best treated as lower
limits on the gas temperature.

and red $S/N > 50$.  The black line shows a three-element piecewise fit
to the data.
}
{fig:ratiovstem}{0.6}{0}

\subsection{Temperature Maps}
\label{sec:formaldehydetemmap}
Using the piecewise relation derived in Section \ref{sec:dendromod}, we
converted the ratio map shown in Figure \ref{fig:ratiomaps} to a temperature
map in Figure \ref{fig:temmap}a.  Because this map includes the full line-of-sight
integrated emission, there are many regions where multiple independent components
are being mixed.

Figure \ref{fig:temmap}b shows a temperature map created by measuring the
temperature in each clump from the dendrogram clump extraction based on the
smoothed data cube and averaging over the velocity axis.  Because there are
hierarchically nested clumps in the dendrogram-based clumpfind, and because
there are genuinely independent clumps along common lines of sight, there is
still overlap and confusion.  The nested clumps in the dendrogram can provide
more than one temperature measurement per voxel; we therefore use the most
compact clump's temperature measurement for each voxel.

The two temperature maps broadly agree, but the dendrogram map is smoother and
aesthetically superior.  The noisy edges of regions in Figure \ref{fig:temmap}a
are unlikely to be real temperature features, so the dendrogram map is
preferred.

These temperature maps do not have uniform reliability, unfortunately.  There
is some spatial variation in the noise, but the variation in the signal is much
more important.  In regions where the peak signal is low, the reliability of
these maps is substantially reduced.  Figure \ref{fig:peaksn} shows the peak
signal-to-noise in both the unsmoothed and the smoothed maps to indicate where
the temperature measurements can be relied upon.  We have also applied a mask
to both panels of Figure \ref{fig:temmap} to make the low-reliability regions
blend into the background by adding a foreground gray layer with opacity set by
the inverse S/N from Figure \ref{fig:peaksn}b.

The effective range of detected temperatures is $\approx40-150$ K. While lower
and higher temperatures appear in the map, those measurements should not be
trusted.  Below $T\lesssim40$ K, all temperature measurements are effectively
upper limits, generally corresponding to $T\lesssim40$ K as shown.  This limit
is due to a combination of sensitivity and excitation: below 40 K, the \para
lines are observed to be faint, and therefore the \threetwoone line is not
detected.  If the high column density gas in, e.g., G0.253+0.016 had a lower
gas temperature, our data would be sensitive enough to measure temperature down
to $T\sim20$ K.  The higher temperatures become lower limits above $\sim150$ K
because the \para line ratio is intrinsically insensitive to higher
temperatures as can be seen in Figure\ref{fig:parsonbrightness}.

\subsection{Parameter Comparison}
In a turbulent medium, the 1D line width of the gas should be tightly
correlated with the 3D Mach number \citep[e.g.][]{Federrath2011a}.  If
turbulence is the dominant gas heating mechanism, there should also be a
correlation between the Mach number of the turbulence and the gas temperature.
However, Figure \ref{fig:temvsfwhm_regions} shows no such correlation.  For
dendrogram-extracted regions, which consist of multiple nested clumps, there
are trends between the linewidth and temperature, but not with the naively
expected sign.  These trends are likely due to variation in the `clump' size.

symbols are compact `clump' sources and the red symbols are large-area
($8\arcmin$) square regions.  No trend between the line width and temperature
is obvious.  The very broad line regions, FWHM $\gtrsim$ 40 \kms, are affected
by significant baseline issues, and it is possible that the temperature has been
underestimated as a result.
(b) The same as (a) but for the dendrogram-extracted sources.  The arc of points
from $\sigma_v=12$ to $8$ \kms and $T=80$ to $140$ K is from the hierarchy of
Sgr B2 clumps and thus represents a variation in temperature with size scale.
Similarly, the other high-linewidth points represent large interconnected
structures.  In the range $1 < \sigma_v < 5$ \kms, which is the only region
including low temperatures, no trend is observed.}

\subsection{Variation with Spatial Scale}
For any given cloud, the ratio \Rone varies with the spatial averaging scale.
The \para \threeohthree line is often stronger relative to \threetwoone on
larger scales, while the linewidth is always larger on larger scales.  We have
examined this effect by selecting a few local \para \threeohthree peaks and
measuring the ratio \Rone as a function of aperture size.  For each spectrum,
we have fitted the 6-parameter model described in Section
\ref{sec:linemodeling} to derive the ratio.

Different variations with scale are observed.  For example, around `The Brick',
the ratio decreases from $\sim0.55$ at the position $\ell=0.237$, $b=0.008$

is lowest at the center and higher on larger scales.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Disagreement between gas and dust temperatures}
Similar to the results of \citet{Ao2013a} for the inner $\sim30$ pc, we find
that the \para and dust temperatures do not agree anywhere within the inner
$\sim200$ pc.  Figure \ref{fig:temvstem_regions} shows the fitted \para
temperature vs the fitted dust temperature from HiGal.  The majority of the
\formaldehyde data points are well above the $T_{dust}=T_{gas}$ line
independent of the method used to extract the temperature.  The small handful
of data points near the $T_{dust}=T_{gas}$ line are the low signal-to-noise
points with untrustworthy fits.

\subsection{Regional variations in gas temperature}
There are significant regional variations in the gas temperature.  The most
obvious is in and around the Sgr B2 complex, where very high gas temperatures
are inferred.  High gas temperatures, $T>50$ K, were measured in a ridge to the
Galactic northeast of Sgr B2 N using \methylcyanide previously \citep[][Figure
4b]{de-Vicente1997a}, which we now confirm.  \citet{Ott2014a} also showed high
\ammonia temperatures in this hot ridge.

The high temperatures in the Sgr B2 region, $T>80$ K, extend to a radius of
$\sim10$ pc (5\arcmin), and nearly 30 pc (12.5\arcmin) in the
northwest/southeast directions.  A high temperature `ridge' follows along the
positive-latitude component of the \citet{Molinari2011a} `ring', tracing
through The Brick into the Sgr A complex.

By contrast, lower temperatures, $T\sim60$ K, are observed in the
negative-latitude component of the `ring'.  At positive longitudes,
$\ell\gtrsim0.9$, the gas is uniformly $T\sim60$ K.  Similarly, most of the gas
in the Sgr C complex is around 60 K.

Figure \ref{fig:kdlorbit} shows the orbital fit from \citet{Kruijssen2014d} and
a position-velocity slice through the fitted temperature cube following that
orbit.  The fit is imperfect, especially along the green segment, but still very useful
for tracking the properties of clouds in common environments.
Intriguingly, the `back-side' clouds (green segment), are cooler than
many of those on the front side, such as The Brick (red segment).  Nontheless,
many of the clouds besides The Brick within the molecular `ring' are among the
coldest detected in our survey.

Perhaps the most interesting feature of the orbital extraction is the qualitative
difference between the `big clouds', Sgr B2, Sgr A, and The Brick, and the rest
of the gas.  At least in terms of gas temperature, The Brick is in the same class
as the massive star-forming Sgr B2 complex and the clouds closest to the central
black hole.

\subsection{Comparison to \citet{Ott2014a} \ammonia temperature map}
\label{sec:ammoniacompare}
\citet{Ott2014a} measured the \ammonia 1-1 and 2-2 lines over a subset of the
region we mapped, from $-0.2 < \ell < 0.8$.  These two lines are a frequently
used thermometer sensitive to gas temperatures $5 \lesssim T \lesssim 40$ K,
with very modest sensitivity up to $\sim80$ K.  The \ammonia lines also have
lower critical densities by about 2 orders of magnitude.  The temperatures
derived from this line ratio are necessarily lower than those we have measured.
Nonetheless, we compare our temperature map to that of \citet{Ott2014a} to look
for common trends and significant differences.

Figure \ref{fig:nh3tmap} shows the \citet{Ott2014a} temperature map in a
similar color scheme to that we have used in Figure \ref{fig:temmap}, but with
different limits.  There are some trends that are common between the two maps:
the Sgr A complex and Sgr B2 complex are the warmest regions, the `diffuse' gas
surrounding these is somewhat cooler, and the positive latitude component of
the \citet{Molinari2011a} `ring' is warmer than the negative latitude
component.

The most significant difference occurs in the southwest portion of the Sgr B2
cloud.  In this region, the \ammonia temperature transitions from the high
($T>80K$) temperatures of the Sgr B2 N hot ridge into a cooler background
$T\sim30-40$ K.  By contrast, the \formaldehyde temperatures stay high,
indicating gas temperatures $T>150$ K extending $\sim2.5\arcmin$ (6 pc) to the
southwest of Sgr B2 S.  This difference probably indicates that there is a
massive, cool, diffuse component being detected in \ammonia, while
\formaldehyde is detecting a hotter, denser component.

\subsection{Comparison to other measurements with \para}
The largest survey of \para temperatures prior to this work was
\citet{Ao2013a}, who observed the inner 30 pc.  They performed a similar
analyis to ours but over a limited area.  They reported temperatures
systematically lower by 10-20 K (but still $T\gtrsim50$ K).  This difference is
due to a different set of collision rates adopted (\citet{Wiesenfeld2013a}
rather than \citet{Green1991a}) and different priors on the fitted parameter
space.  In particular, we left density as a free parameter and instead broke
degeneracies with a conservative but nonetheless useful constraint on the
column density and abundance.

The \citet{Ao2013a} survey found uniformly high temperatures within the bright
Sgr A cloud complex.  Our survey finds a greater variety in gas temperatures,
with significant contrast between the back-side cool clouds and the warmer
foreground infrared dark clouds.

There have also been observations of \para temperatures with interferometers.
\citet{Johnston2014a} noted a very high temperature peak, $T>320$ K, using these
lines of \para toward The Brick, G0.253+0.015.  We measure similar line
ratios toward The Brick, but on larger scales.  The interpretation of these
line ratios is subject to some question, though.  Above 300K, the collision
rates provided by LAMDA \citep{Green1991a,Schoier2005a,Wiesenfeld2013a} must be
extrapolated.  Additionally, some of the ratios cannot be reproduced by high
temperatures, but instead require that the lines be thermalized and therefore
at very high densities.   Given the low brightness temperatures observed,
the emission must be coming from an extremely small area, which is inconsistent
with the observed large extent of the emission unless it is also extremely
patchy.  That remains a possibility if we are observing massive, dense clouds
with relatively uniform turbulent properties.



\subsection{Discussion of Heating Mechanisms}
\citet{Ao2013a} examined four heating mechanisms in the inner $\sim 40$ pc,
concluding that the only viable heating mechanisms capable of explaining the
high observed temperatures in the molecular gas are cosmic ray and turbulent
heating.  

The cosmic ray heating rate required by the \citet{Ao2013a} analysis is high,
$\zeta\sim1-2\ee{-14}$ \pers, but plausible.  The turbulence in the CMZ is also
enough to explain the observed gas temperatures. 
The analysis performed in \citet{Ao2013a} determined the gas temperature
assuming that the observed temperature corresponds to an equilibrium between
heating by a single mechanism for all of the gas mass.  For cosmic ray-driven
heating, this is a reasonable approximation: the CR-derived gas temperature
has a weak density dependence ($T_{kin}\sim n^{1/6}$) and the energy deposited
by cosmic rays should be relatively uniform per molecule.  Turbulent heating,
on the other hand, is nonuniform \citep{Pan2009a}.

Non-uniform heating of the molecular gas could explain the temperature
structure observed in the CMZ molecular clouds.  If supersonic shocks within
the gas are responsible for heating the gas above a mean background temperature
$T_{gas} \sim T_{dust}$, only about 10\% of the gas needs to be heated to
$T\sim50-100$ K to generate the line brighntess observed \emph{if} the hottest
gas is also the densest.  However, hot and dense gas cools more efficiently, so
sustaining a population of shock-heated gas may be infeasible.  Additionally,
the log-poisson distribution followed by a multiplicative cascade has a substantial
low-temperature tail \citep{Pan2009a}, which implies that the mean temperature
must be near the observed temperature.

% However, it is still possible
% to distinguish cosmic ray and turbulent heating if one dominates over the
% other: turbulent heating depends strongly on the velocity dispersion ($\Gamma
% \propto \sigma_V^3$), while CR heating should have no dependence on the
% velocity dispersion.  Additionally, turbulence has a scale dependence, since
% the global dynamics (rotation) dominates over turbulence on scales larger than
% the scale height in the CMZ: $h\sim10$ pc (4\arcmin) in the 100-pc `ring',
% $h\sim50$ pc (20\arcmin) in the $\ell=1.3\arcdeg$ cloud \citep{Kruijssen2013a}.
% I'm not sure this really makes sense.  Is it even possible to measure the gas
% temperature on larger physical/angular scales?

% These differences result in testable predictions.  If turbulence is the
% dominant heating mechanism in the CMZ clouds, there should be a correlation
% between the observed line width and the gas kinetic temperature.

% \todo{This is speculative.}  In a highly turbulent medium, most of the power
% dissipation happens on the smallest size scale (if $L > \sigma_v^3$).  If the
% cooling rate is enhanced in the postshock medium, the high gas temperature will
% be isolated to high-density, compact clumps, but these clumps will also
% dominate the line emission.  \todo{This should result in a density dependence
% of the temperature or observed temperature $T(n) > n^1$, maybe $T(n) \sim n^2$ ?}
% Cosmic rays should not exhibit this behavior; they should heat all scales equally
% and care only about the \emph{mean} density.

%\subsection{Shocks}
%Assuming the dust temperature reflects the mean gas temperature and only a subset
%of the gas has been heated to the high observed temperatures, we can determine the
%shock velocity required to supply the heating.  Assuming an adiabatic strong shock,
%$T_{ps} = \frac{3}{16}\frac{\mu v_s^2}{k}$, where $\mu = \mu_{\hh} = 2.8$.  A 1 \kms
%strong shock can produce a postshock temperature of 65 K.  With observed linewidths 

%\section{Examination of Individual Spectra}
%%\todo{The modeling is ambiguous still: it is necessary to impose some sort of
%%restriction on the abundance or column density in order to acquire reasonable
%%constraints on the temperature.}
%In order to maximize the signal-to-noise and acquire the strongest constraint
%on the temperature, we extract spectra for regions with bright lines.  This
%approach is similar to the approach adopted in \citet{Ao2013a}, but for a much
%larger area.

%\subsection{Sources in the Ring}
%
%\subsubsection{The Brick: G0.253+0.016}
%We examine two lines of sight through The Brick, in the northeast at
%G0.241+0.006 and in the southwest at G0.261+0.028.  The northeast line of sight
%has two independent velocity components with dramatically different
%temperatures: a 30 \kms component with only a lower limit on temperature,
%$T>300$ K, and a 0 \kms component with $T=73\pm3$ K.  The southwest line of
%sight has only one component with $T=157\pm10$ K.
%
%\subsubsection{Cloud d: G0.38+0.04}
%Cloud ``d'' is one of the possible protoclusters identified in
%\citet{Longmore2013a}.  It exhibits bright and relatively narrow (FWHM$\sim7.3$
%\kms) \para emission and has a tightly constrained temperature $T=84\pm5$ K.

%\subsection{Clouds e/f: G0.47+0.01}
%Clouds ``e'' and ``f'' together make another proto-cluster in
%\citet{Longmore2013a}.  These clouds are marginally warmer than cloud d, with
%$T=110\pm20$ K.  However, because of the region of parameter space the lines
%allow, the density is reasonably constrained to be $n(\hh)\sim10^{4\pm0.2}$ \percc,
%much lower than in cloud d and more comparable to The Brick.

\section{Conclusion}
There is warm ($T\gtrsim80$ K) pervading the CMZ out to a radius $\sim200$ pc.
However, there is also significant contrast in gas temperature, with massive
clouds such as The Brick, Sgr B2, and the Sgr A cloud complex exhibiting
temperatures in excess of $T>150$ K.

\appendix
\section{Baseline Removal}
The baselines in our SHFI-1 data were particularly problematic, more than is
usual in modern heterodyne obervations.  The 218 GHz window we have observed is
particularly sensitive to resonances within the SHFI-1 receiver that vary on
$<1$ minute timescales; our off-position calibrations were performed about once
per minute and therefore were not rapid enough to mitigate this problem
completely.  The baselines can broadly be described as smoothly varying ripples
on the scale of $\sim1/10$ the spectral window, plus more rapidly varying
ripples on 20-40 \kms scales.  In principle, this is a straightforward problem
of identifying the fourier components associated with each of these scales and
subtracting them.

In practice, we discovered that it was not possible to remove the dominant
baseline structure on either scale without significantly affecting the
underlying spectral data.  We simulated a variety of fourier-space suppression
approaches by adding synthetic signal to baseline spectra extracted from the
first few PCA components of the real spectra.
The PCA extraction approach is able to pull out the dominant baseline
components very effectively, but it inevitably includes significant signal in
the top few most correlated components, especially for the strong \formaldehyde
and \thirteenco lines.  We therefore abandoned it for the final data reduction.

For reference, we show an example spectrum that we believe to consist entirely
of baseline ripples in Figure \ref{fig:badbaselines}.

\Figure{figures/worst_baselines_map001_withsynth}
{An example showing some of the worst baselines observed.  The plotted spectrum
is from an observation on April 2, 2014, showing the average of the 5\% worst
spectra.  The blue curve shows a $\sigma=5$ \kms (FWHM$=11.75$ \kms) line centered
at the 0 \kms position of \para \threeohthree,
illustrating that the baseline `ripples' have widths comparable to the observed
lines.  While we selected the worst 5\% in this case, nearly all spectra are
affected by these sorts of baselines, and the shape and amplitude varies
dramatically and unpredictably.  The variation, unpredictable though it is,
works in our favor as it averages out over multiple independent observations.
The 218 GHz region shown here is also the worst-affected; the 220 GHz range
that includes the \thirteenco lines generally exhibits smoother and
lower-amplitude baseline spectra.}

\section{Ratio Examination of Individual Regions}
\todo{While figures have been made for this, they will not be included unless
necessary.}
To further examine the reliability of the ratio determination, we have examined
individual regions in the unsmoothed images on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using
\texttt{pyspeckit} to fit a 4-parameter model (amplitude, centroid, width, and
$R_1$) to each spectrum with constrained velocity range and width.  These fits
were performed on the locally baseline-subtracted data cubes.
