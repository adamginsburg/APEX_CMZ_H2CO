\section{Introduction}
\todo{The introduction needs to be cleaned up.}
The central region of our Galaxy is the nearest location in which we can study
star formation in an `extreme' environment with pressure, turbulent Mach number, 
and gas temperature much higher than in local star forming regions.  While
there have been great leaps in our understanding of low-mass star formation
from local molecular clouds in the past decade
\citep{Lada2012a,Heiderman2010a,Lada2010a}, there remain many unanswered
questions about how star formation changes as gas becomes denser, more opaque,
and more turbulent, as it most likely was in galaxies at the peak of cosmic
star formation \citep{Kruijssen2013a}.


The central $\sim100$ pc `ring' \citep{Sofue1995a,Molinari2011a} has attracted
a great deal of attention recently, as it has the most gas in the CMZ and a
large, but unrealized, star-forming potential
\citep{Longmore2013a,Longmore2012b,Longmore2012a,Kruijssen2013a,Yusef-Zadeh2009a,Immer2012a}.
The star formation in this region appears to be suppressed relative to
expectations based on nearby star-forming regions and nearby (on a different
scale) Galactic disks
\citep{Kennicutt1998a,Kennicutt2012a,Leroy2013a,Heiderman2010a}.
\citet{Longmore2013a} recently propose that the clouds along the ring represent
a time-ordered path from starless to star-forming clouds, from `The Brick'
(G0.253+0.016, cloud a) through the lettered clouds \citep[cloud
b,c,d,e,f][]{Lis199a}, ending at Sgr B2.

Variations in star formation rate at a fixed gas surface density are observed
in extragalactic nuclear regions even without AGN.  For example in the nuclei of NGC
1614 and NGC 34, both galaxies with $r\sim200$ pc nuclear starburst rings, the
star formation
rate is well above the standard star formation laws \citep{Xu2014b}.  However,
in our own Galaxy's $r\sim100$ pc circumnuclear ring (not to be confused with the
circumnuclear disk within $\sim1$ pc of Sgr A*), star formation is lower.

Hypotheses for this reduced star formation rate include suppressed
fragmentation by cosmic ray and X-ray heating and a raised star formation
threshold from enhanced turbulence.  \citet{Papadopoulos2010a} and
\citet{Papadopoulos2011a} suggested that high temperatures driven by cosmic
rays may suppress fragmentation.  \citet{Kruijssen2014c} concluded that the
`threshold' for star formation must be higher in the CMZ to explain the
suppressed star formation rate, and therefore turbulence is the essential
mechanism.  

The geometry of CMZ gas is frequently a subject of debate.  While we can in
some cases see absorption signatures indicating the relative line-of-sight
positions of clouds and stars \citep{Longmore2012b,Yusef-Zadeh2012a}, we are
still limited by seeing the CMZ edge-on.  There are known foreground clouds
along the line of sight to the Galactic Center that can be distinguished in
part by their relative line widths, with Galactic Center clouds having typical
linewidths $\sigma_{FWHM}\gtrsim5$ \kms and local clouds $\sigma_{FWHM}
\lesssim 2$ \kms, but this only provides a qualitative distance, distinguishing
nearby ($d\sim1-5$ kpc) from clouds within the central kiloparsec.  Additionally,
there is significant velocity confusion within the Galactic center: many clouds
are seen to overlap in velocity while they are not necessarily at the same distance
\citep{Jones2012a,Oka2012a}

There is a long-standing problem that the observed gas and dust temperatures do
not agree throughout the CMZ
\citep{Guesten1981a,Ao2013a,Ott2014a,Molinari2011a}.  This discrepancy
represents a significant problem for understanding the interplay between gas
temperature and star formation since the gas temperature is dynamically
important.  The dust temperature is readily determined via continuum mapping
and therefore is often used as a proxy for the gas temperature, but the dust
temperature itself is hydrodynamically unimportant.

These prior works primarily used the popular ammonia (\ammonia) metastable
inversion transition thermometer, which is sensitive to moderate density gas
\citep[$n(\hh) \sim 10^3-10^4$ \percc][]{Shirley2015a}.  While this thermometer is
generally reliable in cold regions, the population of the higher energy states
- those sensitive to temperatures $T\gtrsim60$ K - may be affected by
`formation heating', a mechanism recently discovered to affect much of the CMZ
gas \citep[][]{Lis2014a,Mills2013a}.  \citet{Ao2013a} used the \para 220 GHz
thermometer \citep{Mangum1993a}, which is sensitive to denser gas
($n\sim10^4-10^5$ \percc), and still found a significant discrepancy between
gas and dust temperature, but they only
covered the inner 30 pc.

We adopt a distance $d=8.5$ kpc for all measurements made in this paper.

We describe new observations using the \para thermometer in Section
\ref{sec:observations}.  In Section \ref{sec:signal}, we describe the analysis
process used to extract signal from the data cubes and derive temperatures.  We
discuss various implications of our data in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.  In
the appendices, we describe further details of the data reduction process,
provide additional tables, and provide the source code for this project.


\section{Observations \& Data Reduction}
\label{sec:observations}

\subsection{Observations}
\todo{Specify rest frequencies.}
We observed the Central Molecular Zone from $-0.4\arcdeg < \ell < 1.6\arcdeg$ with the SHFI-1
instrument \citep{Vassilev2008a} on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX)
telescope using the eXtended bandwidth Fast Fourier Transform Spectrometer
(XFFTS) backend.
The observations were performed in service mode, and were spread out over two
years.  The time was divided into 25 hours in June 2013, 75 hours in April-July
2014, and 50 hours in October 2014.  The time was split between the ESO
(E-093.C-0144A; 50h), MPIfR (M-091.F-0019 and M-093.F-0009; 75h), and OSO
(E-093.C-0144A; 25h) queues.

The 2013 observations were taken in $4\arcmin \times 4\arcmin$ patches, and the
frequency range covered was 217.5-220 GHz and 216-218.5 GHz in the two spectral
windows.  Scans were performed along lines of constant RA and Dec.

The 2014 observing strategy was modified to use larger $8\arcmin \times
8\arcmin$ scans along lines of Galactic latitude and longitude.  The frequency
range was also shifted to cover windows over 217-219.5 and 218.4-220.9 GHz, thus
including the bright \thirteenco and \ceighteeno 2-1 lines.


The raw data were acquired with 32768 spectral channels in each window, yielding
0.1 \kms resolution.  We downsampled the data by a factor of 8 to 0.8 \kms
resolution to make the data more manageable.  We also expect to see no lines
narrower than a few \kms in the CMZ, particularly not with the relatively
shallow observations we have acquired.

Additionally, for the \para data, we incorporated the 41 hours of observations
using the older fast fourier transform spectrometer (FFTS) backend from
\citet{Ao2013a}.  These data covered only 2
GHz of bandwidth, including all three of the \para lines, but they did not
cover the CO lines.

The system temperature ranged from $120 < T_{sys} < 200$ K for the majority of
the observations, with a mean $T_{sys}=165$ K.  A small fraction (10\%) of
observations were in the range $200 < T_{sys} < 300$ K.  There were also a very
small number ($<1\%$) with much higher system temperatures, $300 < T_{sys} <
750$ K that were flagged out (see Section\ref{sec:flagging}).
%, but these are associated with observations of the bright Sgr B2
%continuum source . 

\subsection{Reduction}
\subsubsection{Calibration}
Calibration was performed at the telescope using the standard APEX calibration
tools
\footnote{See the observing manuals:
\url{www.apex-telescope.org/documents/public/APEX-MPI-MAN-0012.pdf}
\url{www.apex-telescope.org/documents/public/APEX-MPI-MAN-0013.pdf} }.
These yield flux-calibrated spectra at each position with appropriate pointing
information.  Typical flux calibration uncertainties are $\sim10\%$ and
pointing errors $\sigma\lesssim2$\arcsec. % Carlos de Breuck, privat comm

There was a significant calibration error discovered at the APEX telescope during
a large segment of the 2014 observing campaign
(\url{http://www.apex-telescope.org/heterodyne/shfi/calibration/calfactor/}).
The calibration errors were of order $\sim15-25\%$.  We corrected the data using
the correction factors suggested on the calibration page, but the remaining
calibration uncertainty is higher in this data, $\sim15\%$ total rather than
the usual $\sim10\%$.

\subsubsection{Flagging bad spectra}
\label{sec:flagging}
Spectra were removed if they showed excessive noise compared to the
theoretical expectation given the measured system temperature.  As in
\citet{Ao2013a}, the threshold was set to $1.5\times$ the theoretical noise,
i.e. $1.5 \sqrt{2} T_{sys} (\Delta\nu t_{exp})^{0.5}$, where $t_{exp}$ is the
exposure time (integration time) per spectrum in seconds and $\Delta\nu$ is the
channel width in Hz.  This approach resulted in $\sim0.2\%$ of the data being
removed.  

At the position of Sgr B2, the noise was significantly higher due to signal
from the continuum source.  We therefore disabled this flagging in a
$2.5\arcmin$ box around Sgr B2.
% This is surprising, as Christian pointed out: Sgr B2 should only be 3-4 K in the
% continuum
% In [35]: (120*u.Jy).to(u.K, u.brightness_temperature((30/2.35*u.arcsec)**2*np.pi*2, 220*u.GHz))
% Out[35]: <Quantity 3.3529547153047083 K>


% Removing these baselines by
% the usual technique of masking out the emitting spectral region and fitting a
% low-order polynomial to the surroundings is somewhat impractical in the
% Galactic Center, where baseline ripples are on comparable scales to the
% extremely wide spectral lines.

%This method was abandoned: it resulted in negative bowls
% We perform a scan-by-scan baseline subtraction as follows: 
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Compute the mean spectrum across the scan
%     \item Identify pixels $>1-\sigma$ above the mean spectrum to be ignored
%         when baseline fitting (this is a simple `line masking' process)
%     \item Fit a line to each spectral channel across the scan
%     \item Smooth the fitted line parameters with a gaussian with with
%         $\sigma=10$ channels, interpolating into the line-masked regions
%     \item Subtract the fitted baselines
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% We therefore adopted a principle component analysis (PCA) baseline removal
% approach in which the data were spectrally smoothed and downsampled by an
% additional factor of 25, for a characteristic frequency scale of 15 MHz.  The
% data had their means subtracted before PCA cleaning so that only time-variable
% baseline variation was removed.  The resulting data were decomposed into
% eigenspectra, of which the 3 most correlated components were then set to zero.
% These components visually match the baseline ripples, and due to the wide
% smoothing (20 \kms resolution), no line information is lost.  The selection of
% 3 components was determined empirically by examining the eigenspectra; a test
% removing the first 10 components showed no significant difference in the
% cleaning but did show signs of extracting large-scale correlated signal.

% show the baselines that are removed by PCA cleaning.  They do not include any
% signal from the spectral lines.  \todo{This will be
% replaced with a higher-quality figure}}
% {fig:eigenspectra}{0.5}{0}


\subsubsection{Mapmaking}
The maps were made by computing an output grid in Galactic coordinates with
7.2\arcsec pixels and adding each spectrum to the cube at the appropriate
pixel\footnote{We use the term `pixel' to refer to a square data element
projected on the sky with axes in Galactic coordinates.  The term `voxel' is
used to indicate a cubic data element, with two axes in galactic coordinates
and a third in frequency or velocity} location.  In order
to avoid empty pixels and maximize the signal-to-noise, the spectra were added
to the grid with a weight set from a gaussian with $FWHM=10\arcsec$, which
effectively smooths the output images from $FWHM\approx28\arcsec$ to
$\approx30\arcsec$.  See \citet{Mangum2007a} for more detail on the on-the-fly
mapping technique used here.  The spectra were averaged with inverse-variance
weighting.


%\todo{To demonstrate the utility of the PCA subtraction approach described in Section
%\ref{sec:baseline}, we show maps of the \formaldehyde \threeohthree line before
%and after PCA subtraction.}

The PPV cubes were created with units of brightness temperature on the corrected
antenna temperature scale ($T_A^*$).  The
main beam efficiency is $\eta_{mb} = 0.75$ (gain $\sim39$
Jy/K)\footnote{\url{http://www.apex-telescope.org/telescope/efficiency/}}.
These values are noted in the FITS headers of the released data.

The maps achieved a depth of $\sigma=50-80$ mK in 1 \kms channels (Figure
\ref{fig:noisestats}).  The noise is moderately lower (about 15\%) than
expected from the online APEX calculator because our noise measurements are
made in moderately smoothed maps.
%While Figure \ref{fig:noisestats} shows the
%generally good performance of SHFI-1 during our observations, our data are
%affected by significant baseline problems which tend to obscure signal.

%{fig:noisestats}{0.5}{0}


\subsection{Baselining}
\label{sec:baseline}
The data showed significant baseline structure, leading to large-scale
correlated components in the resulting spectra.  The baselines were removed
after generating cubes over a velocity range $-150 < v_{LSR} < 150$ \kms by the
following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item identify bright regions in the \para \threeohthree line using the
        technique described in Section \ref{sec:signal}
    \item mask the regions identified as \threeohthree-bright for each other 
        spectral line data cube
    \item fit a polynomial to the un-masked data
    \item subtract the fitted polynomial
\end{enumerate}
We used a 7th-order polynomial for this process because lower order baseline
removal left a significant and patterned residual.  A more detailed examination
of the baseline removal process is described in Appendix
\ref{sec:baselineappendix}.

\section{Signal Extraction \& Masking}
\label{sec:signal}
We use the method described partially in \citet{Ao2013a} and more thoroughly in
\citet{Dame2011b} to mask the data cubes at locations of significant signal in 
the brightest line. 
A noise map was created by computing the sample standard deviation over a
200 \kms range in which no signal was present.
We use the \para \threeohthree line to create the mask by
the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Smooth the data with a gaussian of width 2 pixels in each direction
        (spatial and spectral)
    \item Identify all pixels with brightness $T_A > 2\sigma$ in the smoothed
        map
    \item Grow the mask from the previous step by 1 pixel in each direction
        (this is known in image processing as binary dilation)
\end{enumerate}

The \para \threeohthree mask was then applied to the \threetwoone and
\threetwotwo cubes created with the same PPV gridding.  There is some overlap
between the \methanol \fourtwotwo line and the \para \threetwotwo line in PPV
space, so we shifted the \para \threeohthree mask to the velocity of the
\methanol line in the \para \threetwotwo cube and excluded those pixels expected
to contain \methanol emission.
However, inspection of the \threetwotwo cube revealed that significant chunks
of the \threetwotwo signal were excised by this masking, so all further
analysis excludes the \threetwotwo line.

We found that much of the cube included marginal detections at the original
resolution, FWHM=$30\arcsec$ and $\Delta v=1$ \kms.  We therefore created
smoothed cubes, smoothing in the spatial dimensions with a
$\sigma_{FWHM}=33.84\arcsec$ gaussian to achieve a resolution 45\arcsec, and
$\sigma_{v, FWMH} = 3$ \kms in the spectral direction.  The smoothed cubes were
also downsampled by a factor of 2 in the spectral direction.  We then performed
the same signal extraction analysis described above, but with a threshold $T_A
> 3\sigma$.  Integrated intensity maps of both the original and the smoothed
data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:integ303} for the \threeohthree map masked
with the above method in and Figure \ref{fig:integ321} for the \threetwoone map
using the mask created from the \threeohthree data.

\subsection{Ratio Maps}
\label{sec:ratio}
We have created \Rone ratio maps as a first step toward building temperature
maps.  In general, a higher \Rone indicates a higher temperature, and therefore
the ratio maps are a good proxy for \emph{relative} temperature.  We display
four different varieties of ratio map in Figures \ref{fig:ratiomaps} and
\ref{fig:ratiomapssm}.

Figure \ref{fig:ratiomaps} shows maps created by creating ratio cubes, in which
each voxel has the value $R_1=\Rone$, then averaging across velocity with
constant weight for each voxel in Figure \ref{ratiomaps}a and with the weight
set by the \threeohthree brightness value in Fiure \ref{ratiomaps}b; the latter is
equivalent to the ratio of the moment 0 maps shown in Figures
\ref{fig:integ303} and \ref{fig:integ321}.  In both
cases, the mask described in Section \ref{sec:signal} was applied to the cubes
before averaging over velocity.

Figure \ref{fig:ratiomapssm} shows the same process performed on the smoothed
data cubes described in Section \ref{sec:signal}.


%We created two independent ratio maps, \threetwotwo/\threeohthree and
%\threetwoone/\threeohthree, so that the two ratios (which are expected to be
%nearly the same) can be used as a sanity check.  However, in many regions,
%especially those with the greatest signal, the \threetwotwo line is strongly
%affected by contamination from a \methanol line, so that ratio is not
%usable for integrated maps.  The \Rone maps are used for all further analysis.

Ratio maps are subject to dramatic uncertainties in the low signal-to-noise
regime, which is inevitably reached in some parts of the map.  The error
distribution on the ratio becomes non-Gaussian as signal approaches zero,
approaching a pathological Cauchy distribution in which the mean becomes
undefined.
We therefore limited our ratio measurements to regions with significance
$>5\sigma$ in the \threeohthree line and used that line as the denominator
in the ratio.  By using the brighter line as the denominator, we avoid
divide-by-zero numerical errors.

\subsection{Region Extraction}
\label{sec:region}
In order to extract higher signal-to-noise measurements on selected regions, we
broke the data down into subsets using both a by-eye region selection drawing
regions using ds9 and a more systematic approach using a dendrogram-based clump
finding algorithm \citep[][\url{http://dendrograms.org/}]{Rosolowsky2008c}.
The dendrogram clump finding uses a watershed decomposition like other clump
finding methods, but it also extracts clumps at different brightness scales
(different heights in the watershed) and tracks how nested clumps are related
to each other.  Within a hierarchy of nested clumps, the brightest and smallest
is a `leaf' and all associated larger structures are `ancestors' (roots or
trunks and branches).
\citet{Rosolowsky2008c} Figures 1 and 3 give visual representations of this
hierarchy.

% dendro_temperature.py
% TODO: decide whether we used the full resolution or the smoothed version.
% Presently (Jan 5), we are using the smoothed version

We ran the dendrogram/clumpfind extraction analysis on the 
\threeohthree cube data.  We assumed a uniform noise per pixel
$\sigma_{T}=\bar{\sigma_T}=0.07$ K.  We enforced thresholds of a minimum number of
voxels $N_{min}=100$, a peak threshold of $I = 3\sigma$, and a splitting
threshold $\Delta = 2\sigma$, which defines how large the brightness difference
between
the peak pixel and an adjacent pixel must be in order to divide the clump into two
sources.  The exact values of these parameters is not particularly
important, as we are interested in general trends with size-scale and
galactocentric distance, but we caution against overinterpretation of the
resulting catalog as the number of sources and their size and distribution can
change dramatically with small changes in the selected parameters.  The number
and location of voxels included in the catalog is, however, relatively robust
against small parameter changes.

For each extracted blob, we measured the corresponding integrated and peak
emission in the \threetwoone and \thirteenco cubes.  We also extracted the mean
dust temperature and column density from SED fits to Herschel HiGal 170-500\um
maps.  The SED fits were performed on background-subtracted data using an
approach originally described in \citet{Battersby2011a}, which includes details
of the fitting process and specification of assumed physical parameters.  We
also extracted dust column density and temperature using a more naive
pixel-by-pixel approach with no background subtraction
(\url{http://hi-gal-sed-fitter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/}) and found the two
to be consistent.

The by-eye selected regions were extracted less systematically, instead
focusing on peaks in the \threeohthree or \threetwoone emission.  We also
included a series of large square $8\arcmin \times 8\arcmin$ `apertures'
corresponding to each observed field.  For each region extracted in this
fashion, we fit a 1-3 component model as described in Section
\ref{sec:linemodeling}, where each component consists of a 6-parameter
multi-gaussian model.  An example spectrum extracted from a small region
around ``cloud c'' is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cloudcspec}.

column densities $N(\formaldehyde) = 1\ee{11}-1\ee{15.1}$ \persc, and 50
temperatures from 10 to 350 K.  The grid was created using the \texttt{pyradex}
wrapper of RADEX\footnote{\url{https://github.com/adamginsburg/pyradex}} and
collision rates retrieved from LAMDA \citep{Wiesenfeld2003a}.  We then
upsampled these grids by spline interpolating between grid points to acquire a
high-resolution ($T\times n \times N = 250\times100\times101$) grid covering
$10<T<350$ K, $10^{2.5} < n < 10^7$ \percc, and $10^{11} < N < 10^{15.1}$
\persc\perkmspc.

We extracted spectra averaged over selected regions and fitted
a 6-parameter model to the full 218-219 GHz spectral range using
\texttt{pyspeckit} \citep{Ginsburg2011c}.  The fitted parameters are the amplitude of the
\formaldehyde \threeohthree line, the centroid velocity, the line width
($\sigma$), the ratio $R_1 = \Rone$, the ratio $R_2 = \Rtwo$, and the
amplitude of the \methanol \fourtwotwo line.  For these spectra, we performed
a different baseline subtraction to that described in Section
\ref{sec:baseline}.  We first fit the described 6-parameter model, then fit a
spline curve to the residual smoothed to a 50-channel (50 \kms) scale.  We then
re-fit the model to the data.  In all but the lowest signal-to-noise cases,
this approach resulted in consistent ratio measurements between the two fits
and with the other methods.  Figure \ref{fig:twospectra_hotcold} shows two
example spectra that exhibit significantly different ratios with the spline
baseline fit indicated.

For each extracted region (see Section \ref{sec:region}), we created $\chi^2$
grids over the modeled temperature-density-column density parameter space.  We
measured $\chi^2$ with five independent constraints: the line ratio $R_1$, the
\formaldehyde abundance, the total column density of \hh, a lower limit on the
\hh volume density, and an upper limit on the beam filling factor.  We use the
line \emph{ratio} rather than line brightnesses to avoid uncertainties due to
the ``filling factor'' of the emitting gas: even for diffuse clouds, the
filling factor of the emitting
regions may be $ff<<1$ if the emission is isolated to compact shocked regions,
as expected if highly supersonic $\mathcal{M}>10$ turbulence is energetically
dominant in the clouds.  We use an abundance $N(\para)/N(\hh) = X(\para) =
10^{-9.08\pm1} = 1.2\ee{-9} \times/\div 10$, allowing for dramatic uncertainty in
the \formaldehyde abundance
\citep{Ginsburg2013a,Carey1998a,Wootten1978a,Mundy1987a}.  To constrain the
total column density, we use the Herschel dust maps to derive an \hh column
density, which has a nominal $\sim2-3\times$ uncertainty.  We treat the error
as $10\times$ (instead of $\sim2-3\times$) to account for the abundance
uncertainty.  This large assumed error also accounts for an additional factor
$\sim2-3$ uncertainty due to line-of-sight confusion, since the dust column
density cannot be associated with any specific velocity component.  To
constrain the dust density, we assume the selected area has a mass given by the
Herschel dust-derived mass and a spherical volume, which sets a conservative
(but nonetheless highly constraining) lower limit on the volume density.

These constraints are shown projected onto the three planes of our fitted
parameter space in the multi-paneled Figures
\ref{fig:coltemconstraints}-\ref{fig:parsonbrightness}.  The fitted parameters
are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:parsonbrightness}.

While $R_2$ can, in some cases, provide significant constraints on various
parameters, we do not use it because of the ambiguity imposed by the overlap
with the \methanol \fourtwotwo line.

\subsection{Blob modeling}
\label{sec:dendromod}
We derived temperatures for each
dendrogram catalog blob using the measured line ratio, dust column density, 
and a dust-derived lower limit on the volume density as constraints.
The $\chi^2$ grid approach described in Section \ref{sec:linemodeling} was used
to extract the temperature and associated error.

We plot the derived temperature for all clumps against the measured line ratio
in Figure \ref{fig:ratiovstem}.  This figure includes both `leaves' and `ancestors'
from the dendrogram extraction.  The figure illustrates the effects of assuming
higher or lower density on the temperature. The lower density models are
excluded by the observed volume density lower limit from the dust.

$R_1$ for three different assumed densities with a constant assumed abundance.

\subsection{Temperature Maps}
\label{sec:formaldehydetemmap}
Using the relation described in Section \ref{sec:dendromod}, we
converted the ratio map shown in Figure \ref{fig:ratiomaps} to a temperature
map in Figure \ref{fig:temmap}a.  Because this map includes the full line-of-sight
integrated emission, there are many regions where multiple independent components
are being mixed.

%Figure \ref{fig:temmap}b shows a temperature map created by measuring the
%temperature in each clump from the dendrogram clump extraction based on the
%smoothed data cube and averaging over the velocity axis.  Because there are
%hierarchically nested clumps in the dendrogram-based clumpfind, and because
%there are genuinely independent clumps along common lines of sight, there is
%still overlap and confusion.  The nested clumps in the dendrogram can provide
%more than one temperature measurement per voxel; we therefore use the most
%compact clump's temperature measurement for each voxel.

%The two temperature maps broadly agree, but the dendrogram map is smoother and
%aesthetically superior.  The noisy edges of regions in Figure \ref{fig:temmap}a
%are unlikely to be real temperature features, so the dendrogram map is
%preferred.

These temperature maps do not have uniform reliability.  There
is some spatial variation in the noise, but the variation in the signal is much
more important.  In regions where the peak signal is low, the reliability of
these maps is substantially reduced.  Figure \ref{fig:peaksn} shows the peak
signal-to-noise in both the unsmoothed and the smoothed maps to indicate where
the temperature measurements can be relied upon.  We have also applied a mask
to both panels of Figure \ref{fig:temmap} to make the low-reliability regions
blend into the background by adding a foreground gray layer with opacity set by
the inverse S/N from Figure \ref{fig:peaksn}b.

The effective range of detected temperatures is $\approx40-150$ K. While lower
and higher temperatures appear in the map, those measurements should not be
trusted.  Below $T\lesssim40$ K, all temperature measurements are effectively
upper limits, generally corresponding to $T\lesssim40$ K.  This limit
is due to a combination of sensitivity and excitation: below 40 K, the \para
lines are observed to be faint, and therefore the \threetwoone line is not
detected.  If the high column density gas in, e.g., G0.253+0.016 had a lower
gas temperature, our data would be sensitive enough to measure temperature down
to $T\sim20$ K.  The higher temperatures become lower limits above $\sim150$ K
because the \para line ratio is intrinsically insensitive to higher
temperatures, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:parsonbrightness}, in which
the modeled line brightnesses are both nearly constant above $T\grtsim150$ K.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
\subsection{Parameter Comparison}
\todo{Questionable.  Remove this \& Figure \ref{fig:temvsfwhm_regions}?} In a
turbulent medium, the 1D line width of the gas should be tightly correlated
with the 3D Mach number \citep[e.g.][]{Federrath2011a}.  If turbulence is the
dominant gas heating mechanism, there should also be a correlation between the
Mach number of the turbulence and the gas temperature.  However, Figure
\ref{fig:temvsfwhm_regions} shows no such correlation.  There may be a
correlation in the dendrogram-extracted data, but it is weak.

The fitted temperature as described in Section \ref{sec:linemodeling} plotted
against the fitted line width for the by-eye selected regions.  The blue
symbols are compact `clump' sources and the red symbols are large-area
($8\arcmin$) square regions.  No trend between the line width and temperature
is obvious.  The very broad line regions, FWHM $\gtrsim$ 40 \kms, are affected
by significant baseline issues, and it is possible that the temperature has been
underestimated as a result.
(b) The same as (a) but for the dendrogram-extracted sources. The points are
color coded by signal-to-noise in the ratio $R_1$, with black $S/N < 5$, blue
$5 < S/N < 25$, green $25 < S/N < 50$, and red $S/N > 50$.  Small, faint points
indicate ancestors in the dendrogram, while bright, large points indicate leaves.
Lower limits on linewidth and temperature are indicated with triangles on the
edge of the plot.  
Note that in both cases, any correlation is even weaker than that observed in
\citet{Huettemeister1993a} Figure 6, who make the same plot for \ammonia 4-4
and 5-5.

\subsection{Variation with Spatial Scale}
For any given cloud, the ratio $R_1$ varies with the spatial averaging scale.
The \para \threeohthree line is often stronger relative to \threetwoone on
larger scales, while the linewidth is always larger on larger scales.  We have
examined this effect by selecting a few local \para \threeohthree peaks and
measuring the ratio $R_1$ as a function of aperture size.  For each spectrum,
we have fitted the 6-parameter model described in Section
\ref{sec:linemodeling} to derive the ratio.

Different variations with scale are observed.  For example, around `The Brick',
the ratio decreases from $\sim0.55$ at the position $\ell=0.237\arcdeg$, $b=0.008$
within a single spectrum to $\sim0.33$ when averaged over a radius
$\sim70\arcsec$ (Figure \ref{fig:brickradial}a).  By contrast, Figure
\ref{fig:brickradial}b shows a highly turbulent example where the temperature
is lowest at the center and higher on larger scales.  Apparently some regions
are able to cool moderately below the mean temperature, but on the largest
scales a high mean temperature prevails.
%These observations imply
%that two different heating mechanisms, one internally driven (The Brick) and
%one external (G1.23-0.08), are active within the CMZ.

The derived temperature using Figure \ref{fig:ratiovstem} is shown on the right

should be regarded highly skeptically, and temperatures $\gtrsim150$ K should
be regarded as lower limits.

as a function of aperture size.  
(b) The same as (a) but for a region centered on G1.23-0.08, a local

\subsection{Disagreement between gas and dust temperatures}
Similar to the results of \citet{Ao2013a} for the inner $\sim30$ pc, we find
that the \para and dust temperatures do not agree anywhere within the inner
$\sim200$ pc.  Figure \ref{fig:temvstem_regions} shows the fitted \para
temperature vs the fitted dust temperature from HiGal.  The majority of the
\formaldehyde data points are well above the $T_{dust}=T_{gas}$ line
independent of the method used to extract the temperature.  The small handful
of data points near the $T_{dust}=T_{gas}$ line are the low signal-to-noise
points with untrustworthy fits.

\citet{Clark2013a} modeled The Brick with a suite of hydrodynamic simulations
and found that even for such a dense structure, the gas and dust temperature
can be uncoupled if the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and cosmic ray
ionization rate (CRIR) are $\sim1000\times$ their local values.  In their
model, the ISRF determines the dust temperature while the CRIR determines the
gas temperature.  Assuming their model still holds further from Sgr A, our
observations of high gas temperatures imply that the CRIR must remain elevated
to $\sim10^{14}$ out to a projected radius $R_{GC} \sim 250$ pc.

square regions.  The black dashed line shows the $T_g = T_d$ relation.  Nearly

\subsection{Regional variations in gas temperature}
There are significant regional variations in the gas temperature.  The most
obvious is in and around the Sgr B2 complex, where very high gas temperatures
are measured.  High gas temperatures, $T\sim100-120$ K, were measured in a ridge to the
Galactic northeast of Sgr B2 N using \methylcyanide previously \citep[][Figure
4b]{de-Vicente1997a}, which we now confirm, though our data show $T\gtrsim150$ K.
\citet{Ott2014a} also showed relatively high \ammonia temperatures in this hot
ridge.

The high temperatures in the Sgr B2 region, $T>80$ K, extend to a radius of
$\sim10$ pc (5\arcmin), and nearly 30 pc (12.5\arcmin) in the
northwest/southeast directions.  A high temperature `ridge' follows along the
positive-latitude component of the \citet{Molinari2011a} `ring', tracing
through The Brick into the Sgr A complex.

By contrast, lower temperatures, $T\sim60$ K, are observed in the
negative-latitude component of the `ring'.  At positive longitudes,
$\ell\gtrsim0.9\arcdeg$, there are many regions with $T\sim60$ K.  Similarly,
most of the gas in the Sgr C complex is around 60 K.

Figure \ref{fig:kdlorbit} shows the orbital fit from \citet{Kruijssen2014d} and
a position-velocity slice through the fitted temperature cube following that
orbit.  The fit is imperfect, especially along the green segment, but still very useful
for tracking the properties of clouds in common environments.
Intriguingly, the `back-side' clouds (green segment), are cooler than
many of those on the front side, such as The Brick (red segment).  Nontheless,
many of the clouds besides The Brick within the molecular `ring' are among the
coldest detected in our survey.

Perhaps the most interesting feature of the orbital extraction is the qualitative
difference between the `big clouds', Sgr B2, Sgr A, and The Brick, and the rest
of the gas.  At least in terms of gas temperature, The Brick is in the same class
as the massive star-forming Sgr B2 complex and the clouds closest to the central
black hole.

There is some evolution of temperature over time evident in Figure
\ref{fig:kdltemvstime}, which shows the temperature within each
dendrogram-extracted clump within 20 \kms and 6 pc of the
\citet{Kruijssen2014d} orbit.  The linear increase in temperature over the
first $\sim0.5$ Myr seems to support the \citet{Kruijssen2014d} hypothesis that
the `ring' represents a single gas stream on its first passage by Sgr A*.

\subsection{Comparison to \citet{Ott2014a} \ammonia temperature map}
\label{sec:ammoniacompare}
\citet{Ott2014a} measured the \ammonia 1-1 and 2-2 lines over a subset of the
region we mapped, from $-0.2\arcdeg < \ell < 0.8\arcdeg$.  These two lines are
a frequently
used thermometer sensitive to gas temperatures $5 \lesssim T \lesssim 40$ K,
with weak sensitivity up to $\sim80$ K \citep[][Figure 1]{Mangum2013a}.  The
\ammonia lines also have lower critical densities by about an order of
magnitude, $n_{crit}(\ammonia 1-1)\sim10^3$ \percc while $n_{crit}(\para
\threeohthree)\sim10^4$ \percc \citep[Figure \ref{fig:nh3vsh2co}][]{Shirley2015a}.  The temperatures
derived from the \ammonia line ratio are lower by construction than those we have
measured.  Nonetheless, we compare our temperature map to that of
\citet{Ott2014a} to look for common trends and significant differences.

{fig:nh3vsh2co}{0.25}{0}

Figure \ref{fig:nh3tmap} shows the \citet{Ott2014a} temperature map in the same
color scheme that we have used in Figure \ref{fig:temmap}.  There are some
trends that are common between the two maps: the Sgr A complex and Sgr B2
complex are the warmest regions, the `diffuse' gas surrounding these is
somewhat cooler, and the positive latitude component of the
\citet{Molinari2011a} `ring' is warmer than the negative latitude
component.

The most significant difference occurs in the southwest portion of the Sgr B2
cloud.  In this region, the \ammonia temperature transitions from the high
($T>80K$) temperatures of the Sgr B2 N hot ridge into a cooler background
$T\sim30-40$ K.  By contrast, the \formaldehyde temperatures stay high,
indicating gas temperatures $T>150$ K extending $\sim2.5\arcmin$ (6 pc) to the
southwest of Sgr B2 S.  This difference probably indicates that there is a
massive, cool, diffuse component being detected in \ammonia, while
\formaldehyde is detecting a hotter, denser component.

\subsection{Comparison to other measurements with \para}
\label{sec:h2cocompare}
The largest survey of \para temperatures prior to this work was by
\citet{Ao2013a}, who observed the inner 75 pc.  They performed a similar
analysis to ours but over a smaller area.  They reported similar temperatures,
with some small differences due to a different set of collision rates adopted
(\citet{Wiesenfeld2013a} rather than \citet{Green1991a}).
The \citet{Ao2013a} survey found uniformly high temperatures within the bright
Sgr A cloud complex.  Our survey finds a greater variety in gas temperatures due
to the larger area covered, with significant contrast between the back-side
cool clouds and the warmer foreground infrared dark clouds.

There have also been observations of \para temperatures with interferometers.
\citet{Johnston2014a} noted a very high temperature peak, $T>320$ K, using these
lines of \para toward The Brick, G0.253+0.015.  We measure similar line
ratios toward The Brick, but on larger scales.  The interpretation of these
line ratios is subject to some question, though.  Above 300K, the collision
rates provided by LAMDA \citep{Green1991a,Schoier2005a,Wiesenfeld2013a} must be
extrapolated.  Additionally, very high $R_1$ values cannot be
reproduced by high temperatures with the current suite of collision rates, but
instead require that the lines be optically thick and thermalized and therefore
at very high densities.   Given the low brightness temperatures observed, if
the emission is optically thick, it must be coming from an extremely small
area, which is inconsistent with the observed large extent of the emission
unless it is also extremely patchy.  That remains a possibility if we are
observing massive, dense clouds with relatively uniform turbulent properties,
though it is unlikely - we discuss this further in Section
\ref{sec:thickorwarm}.  We conclude, therefore, that a lower limit on the
gas temperature in The Brick, $T\gtrsim120$ K, is consistent with our observations.


\subsection{Discussion of Heating Mechanisms}
\citet{Ao2013a} examined four heating mechanisms in the inner $\sim 40$ pc,
concluding that the only viable heating mechanisms capable of explaining the
high observed temperatures in the molecular gas are cosmic ray and turbulent
heating.  

The cosmic ray heating rate required by the \citet{Ao2013a} analysis is high,
$\zeta\sim1-2\ee{-14}$ \pers, but plausible.  The turbulence in the CMZ is also
enough to explain the observed gas temperatures. 
The analysis performed in \citet{Ao2013a} determined the gas temperature
assuming that the observed temperature corresponds to an equilibrium temperature
for the bulk of the gas.  For
cosmic ray-driven heating, this is a reasonable approximation: the CR-derived
gas temperature
has a weak density dependence ($T_{kin}\sim n^{1/6}$) and the energy deposited
by cosmic rays should be relatively uniform across the cloud.  Turbulent heating,
on the other hand, is nonuniform \citep{Pan2009a}.

Non-uniform heating of the molecular gas could explain the temperature
structure observed in the CMZ molecular clouds.  If supersonic shocks within
the gas are responsible for heating the gas above a mean background temperature
$T_{gas} \sim T_{dust}$, only about 10\% of the gas needs to be heated to
$T\sim50-100$ K to generate the line brightness observed \emph{if} the hottest
gas is also the densest.  However, hot and dense gas cools more efficiently, so
sustaining a population of shock-heated gas may be infeasible.  Additionally,
the log-poisson distribution followed by a multiplicative cascade has a
substantial low-temperature tail \citep{Pan2009a}, which implies that the mean
temperature must be near the observed temperature.  Such an explanation for the
observed temperatures must be investigated more thoroughly, ideally with
hydrodynamic simulations of turbulence using a reasonable treatment for the gas
shock heating and line cooling.
%\todo{It would be nice to have some help
%from a theorist to assess whether non-uniform heating could really drive the observed
%temperatures.}

%Gas temperatures higher than dust temperatures occur in both high and low density
%gas \todo{need to have somes sort of density tracer - probably just dust + spherical}


%\subsection{Radial Variations}
%There are many reasons to expect that gas temperature will increase as gas
%falls toward the Galactic center.  As it falls further in on an elliptical but
%unclosed orbit, the gas is subject to much greater shear near pericenter,
%driving stronger turbulence.  The stellar density increases, implying a
%stronger radiation field.  There may be a
%greater density of young stars, which in turn would imply more supernovae and a
%greater cosmic ray density.  The density of X-ray emitting sources (e.g.,
%stellar remnants) also increases, providing yet another source of heating.
%Finally, the central black hole, while inactive now, may have gone through
%previous bursts of activity, driving brief but powerful waves of X-ray heating.
%Independent of the mechanism, though, there is reason to expect some radial
%variation in temperature.
%
%Figure \ref{fig:temvsrad} shows the latitude-averaged temperature as a
%function of projected radius.  While there is no clear radial trend, there are
%important features: the majority of the gas at $R>0.9\arcdeg$ (130 pc) is below
%$T\lesssim 60$ K, while within $R<0.9\arcdeg$ the majority of the gas is
%between 70 and 120 K (with many lower limits in Sgr B2).  There are hints that
%the cooler gas that is observed in this range may actually be at larger
%galactocentric radii and simply be projected onto the $R=0$ region.

\subsection{A stream of fresh gas falling into the CMZ?}
\label{sec:coolstream}
The gas streamer extending from $\ell=0.2\arcdeg$ to $\ell=1.3\arcdeg$ (Figure
\ref{fig:coolstream}) may represent a stream of infalling gas.  The lack of
IRDC features in the Spitzer 8 \um data corresponding to this stream within
$R<R_{SgrB2}$ restricts it to
be on the back side of the CMZ.  Since it does not align closely with the
\citet{Kruijssen2014d} orbit, this stream is probably not
following the same path as the Brick, the lettered clouds, and Sgr B2.
The large observed linewidths imply that the stream is genuinely associated
with the CMZ, though its distance from Sgr A may be much larger than its
projected distance.  The path we have traced through Figure \ref{fig:coolstream}
has been selected by eye and is not physically motivated (e.g., by a predicted orbit)
but it can be observed as a coherent-appearing stream in the \thirteenco data cubes
as well.
The cool stream does
not appear to be actively star forming at present, most likely because the gas
is at a lower average density.
% yet it contributes to the total cold gas mass
% inferred in the inner galaxy.  However, the total mass within the inner
% projected 200 pc is still dominated by the `ring' clouds and Sgr B2, so at
% least some deficit remains.

\subsection{Is the gas warm or just optically thick?}
\label{sec:thickorwarm}
As noted in Section \ref{sec:h2cocompare}, there is degeneracy in the modeling
that allows the observed ratios to be produced by very dense gas in addition to
hot gas.  Indeed, ratios approaching $R_1=1$ occur for relatively low
temperatures ($T\sim30$ K) at very high densities ($n>10^{6}$ \percc)
and very high column densities ($N(\para)>10^{16}$ \perkms \persc) because
the lines become optically thick and have LTE temperatures.

Since the mean densities at 30\arcsec resolution are always significantly lower
($n\lesssim\mathrm{few}\ee{5}$ \percc), such high density,
optically thick gas would have to have a very low filling factor.  The peak
\para \threeohthree brightness ranged from $0.2 \lesssim T_{mb} \lesssim 2$ K
in the detected regions, implying upper limits on the filling factor 1-7\% if
we assume the resolved brightness temperature equals the dust temperature,
$T_B=T_{dust}$.
In practice, the filling factor would have to be lower still, since any
optically thin \para in surrounding lower-density gas would favor the
\threeohthree line and contribute to a lower \Rone.

The strongest argument against such a scenario is the extremely high column
density required.  At typical \para abundances $X\sim10^{-9}$, or even more
extreme abundances $X\sim10^{-8}$, the implied local column density is
$N(\hh)\gtrsim10^{25(24)}$ in a single velocity bin.  Column densities up to
$N(\hh)\sim10^{24}$ \percc are observed, but with much lower filling fractions
$ff\sim10^{-4}$, in The Brick \citep[][their Figure 4]{Rathborne2014a}.  Even
in The Brick, the densest cloud besides Sgr B2, higher column densities are not
observed.  So, while it remains possible that optically thick \para is
responsible for the observed line ratios, it is very unlikely, especially
outside the densest clouds.

\todo{Too speculative for the final paper, but kept to generate discussion in
Draft 1.}
One remaining possibility is that the \para lines become optically thick
because of dramatically reduced turbulent line spreading and therefore
increased line trapping.  Such an effect would require a transition from
turbulent to coherent gas motion \citep[e.g.][]{Pineda2010a} and could reduce
the required column densities by $\sim100\times$.  Still, the fact that we
observe \para emission spread over
a wide range of velocities renders this scenario unlikely again.


\subsection{The CMZ average}
For comparison to extragalactic observations, we have included a spectrum
averaged over the whole $\sim300$ pc extent of our survey in Figure
\ref{fig:wholecmzspec}.  The peak amplitude is 50-60 mK and the measured
line ratio $\Rone = 0.25$, corresponding to a temperature $T=64$ K at $n=10^4$
\percc or $T=48$ K at $n=10^5$ \percc.  
Over the same area, the measured mean dust temperature from HiGal is 23 K,
though on such large scales it would be more appropriate to use Planck or WMAP
data to perform this measurement.
The spectral fit is imperfect, showing a non-flat baseline between the
\threetwoone and \threetwotwo lines, but nonetheless the extracted value is
likely representative of the CMZ-wide average.  This temperature is very close
to the \ammonia-measured temperature in M83 \citep[56 K;][]{Mangum2013a}, which
also has a similarly low dust temperature $T_{dust,M83} = 31$ K over a 600 pc
region.  Maffei 2, NGC 1365, and NGC 6946 also exhibit similar gas and dust
temperatures to our Galactic center in the \citet{Mangum2013a} sample,
suggesting that these galaxies all have analogous gas thermal structures in
their inner regions.  The other galaxies in that sample, especially the
starburst galaxies, have significantly warmer gas and dust, with temperatures
closer to those measured for Sgr B2 than for the whole CMZ.

% However, it is still possible
% to distinguish cosmic ray and turbulent heating if one dominates over the
% other: turbulent heating depends strongly on the velocity dispersion ($\Gamma
% \propto \sigma_V^3$), while CR heating should have no dependence on the
% velocity dispersion.  Additionally, turbulence has a scale dependence, since
% the global dynamics (rotation) dominates over turbulence on scales larger than
% the scale height in the CMZ: $h\sim10$ pc (4\arcmin) in the 100-pc `ring',
% $h\sim50$ pc (20\arcmin) in the $\ell=1.3\arcdeg$ cloud \citep{Kruijssen2013a}.
% I'm not sure this really makes sense.  Is it even possible to measure the gas
% temperature on larger physical/angular scales?

% These differences result in testable predictions.  If turbulence is the
% dominant heating mechanism in the CMZ clouds, there should be a correlation
% between the observed line width and the gas kinetic temperature.

% \todo{This is speculative.}  In a highly turbulent medium, most of the power
% dissipation happens on the smallest size scale (if $L > \sigma_v^3$).  If the
% cooling rate is enhanced in the postshock medium, the high gas temperature will
% be isolated to high-density, compact clumps, but these clumps will also
% dominate the line emission.  \todo{This should result in a density dependence
% of the temperature or observed temperature $T(n) > n^1$, maybe $T(n) \sim n^2$ ?}
% Cosmic rays should not exhibit this behavior; they should heat all scales equally
% and care only about the \emph{mean} density.

%\subsection{Shocks}
%Assuming the dust temperature reflects the mean gas temperature and only a subset
%of the gas has been heated to the high observed temperatures, we can determine the
%shock velocity required to supply the heating.  Assuming an adiabatic strong shock,
%$T_{ps} = \frac{3}{16}\frac{\mu v_s^2}{k}$, where $\mu = \mu_{\hh} = 2.8$.  A 1 \kms
%strong shock can produce a postshock temperature of 65 K.  With observed linewidths 

%\section{Examination of Individual Spectra}
%%\todo{The modeling is ambiguous still: it is necessary to impose some sort of
%%restriction on the abundance or column density in order to acquire reasonable
%%constraints on the temperature.}
%In order to maximize the signal-to-noise and acquire the strongest constraint
%on the temperature, we extract spectra for regions with bright lines.  This
%approach is similar to the approach adopted in \citet{Ao2013a}, but for a much
%larger area.
%
%\subsection{Sources in the Ring}
%
%\subsubsection{The Brick: G0.253+0.016}
%We examine two lines of sight through The Brick, in the northeast at
%G0.241+0.006 and in the southwest at G0.261+0.028.  The northeast line of sight
%has two independent velocity components with dramatically different
%temperatures: a 30 \kms component with only a lower limit on temperature,
%$T>300$ K, and a 0 \kms component with $T=73\pm3$ K.  The southwest line of
%sight has only one component with $T=157\pm10$ K.
%
%\subsubsection{Cloud d: G0.38+0.04}
%Cloud ``d'' is one of the possible protoclusters identified in
%\citet{Longmore2013a}.  It exhibits bright and relatively narrow (FWHM$\sim7.3$
%\kms) \para emission and has a tightly constrained temperature $T=84\pm5$ K.

%\subsection{Clouds e/f: G0.47+0.01}
%Clouds ``e'' and ``f'' together make another proto-cluster in

%$T=110\pm20$ K.  However, because of the region of parameter space the lines
%allow, the density is reasonably constrained to be $n(\hh)\sim10^{4\pm0.2}$ \percc,
%much lower than in cloud d and more comparable to The Brick.

\section{Conclusion}
We present the largest gas temperature map of the CMZ to date.  There is warm
($T\gtrsim60$ K) gas pervading the CMZ out to a radius $\sim200$ pc.  However,
there is also significant contrast in gas temperature, with massive clouds such
as The Brick, Sgr B2, and the Sgr A cloud complex exhibiting temperatures in
excess of $T>100$ K.

Our new observations are broadly consistent with the orbital model described by
\citet{Kruijssen2014d}.  While there are some individual discrepancies, it at
least appears that the front-side clouds (The Brick and the lettered clouds on
the path to Sgr B2) have consistent thermal properties and fall along a stream
of progressively increasing temperature as a function of age.  

The 80 \kms cloud stream extending from $\ell=1.2\arcdeg$ to $\ell=0.3\arcdeg$
is relatively cool compared to the rest of the CMZ despite its broad line
width.  The lower temperature hints that it is more distant from pericenter
than the `ring' clouds, and it may therefore represent a fresh stream of gas
infalling into the center.

\appendix
\section{Baseline Removal}
\label{sec:baselineappendix}
The baselines in our SHFI-1 data were particularly problematic, more than is
usual in modern heterodyne obervations.  The 218 GHz window we have observed is
particularly sensitive to resonances within the SHFI-1 receiver that vary on
$<1$ minute timescales; our off-position calibrations were performed about once
per minute and therefore were not rapid enough to mitigate this problem
completely.  The baselines can broadly be described as smoothly varying ripples
on the scale of $\sim1/10$ the spectral window, plus more rapidly varying
ripples on 20-40 \kms scales.  In principle, this is a straightforward problem
of identifying the fourier components associated with each of these scales and
subtracting them.

In practice, we discovered that it was not possible to remove the dominant
baseline structure on either scale without significantly affecting the
underlying spectral data.  We simulated a variety of fourier-space suppression
approaches by adding synthetic signal to baseline spectra extracted from the
first few PCA components of the real spectra.
The PCA extraction approach is able to pull out the dominant baseline
components very effectively, but it inevitably includes significant signal in
the top few most correlated components, especially for the strong \formaldehyde
and \thirteenco lines.  We therefore abandoned it for the final data reduction.

For reference, we show an example spectrum that we believe to consist entirely
of baseline ripples in Figure \ref{fig:badbaselines}.

\Figure{figures/worst_baselines_map001_withsynth}
{An example showing some of the worst baselines observed.  The plotted spectrum
is from an observation on April 2, 2014, showing the average of the 5\% worst
spectra.  The blue curve shows a $\sigma=5$ \kms (FWHM$=11.75$ \kms) line centered
at the 0 \kms position of \para \threeohthree,
illustrating that the baseline `ripples' have widths comparable to the observed
lines.  While we selected the worst 5\% in this case, nearly all spectra are
affected by these sorts of baselines, and the shape and amplitude varies
dramatically and unpredictably.  The variation, unpredictable though it is,
works in our favor as it averages out over multiple independent observations.
The 218 GHz region shown here is also the worst-affected; the 220 GHz range
that includes the \thirteenco lines generally exhibits smoother and
lower-amplitude baseline spectra.}

\section{Ratio Examination of Individual Regions}
\todo{While figures have been made for this, they will not be included unless
necessary.}
To further examine the reliability of the ratio determination, we have examined
individual regions in the unsmoothed images on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using
\texttt{pyspeckit} to fit a 4-parameter model (amplitude, centroid, width, and
$R_1$) to each spectrum with constrained velocity range and width.  These fits
were performed on the locally baseline-subtracted data cubes.

\section{Spectral fits for regions and apertures}
\todo{This section is intended to be electronic-only.}
We provide a catalog of line ratios measured from aperture-extracted spectra
along with figures showing the best fit model for each spectrum.  We have
extracted spectra in regions with significant \para emission and in commonly
studied individual regions.  This catalog is intended to provide archival value
from our data set and enable future studies of individual regions.

In the attached electronic table, three types of region are included: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Circular regions-of-interest (Figure \ref{fig:regions}a)
    \item Rectangular regions-of-interest (Figure \ref{fig:regions}b)
    \item $8\arcmin \times 8\arcmin$ square observation fields (Figure \ref{fig:regions}c)
\end{enumerate}
The fit tables include multicomponent spectral fits with and without
spline-based baseline removal (see Section \ref{sec:linemodeling}).
Spatial parameters for the box (\texttt{GLON}, \texttt{GLAT},
\texttt{boxheight}, and \texttt{boxwidth}) or circle (\texttt{GLON},
\texttt{GLAT}, and \texttt{radius}) regions are included.  The average dust
column and dust temperature are reported (\texttt{higaldusttem} and
\texttt{higalcolumndens}).  The best fit parameters for gas temperature, \para
column, and \hh density are included along with their $\pm1-sigma$ marginalized
limits.

\section{Source code and Data release}
The reduced and raw data are made available via the CfA dataverse
(doi:10.7910/DVN/27601).

The source code for this project in its entirety is available in the attached
tar file and on the internet at
\url{https://github.com/adamginsburg/APEX_CMZ_H2CO}.
Because the archives are public, we include scripts to download and process the
raw data so that all steps of the analysis performed here can be performed by
any individual with access to a computer.  Most of the data sets can be retrieved
in an automated fashion using an \texttt{astroquery}-based script from the ESO archive,
but some of the data is not stored in the archive and must be retrieved manually from the
\texttt{dataverse} servers. The total data reduction process
takes $\sim30$ hours on a 48-core, 2012-era linux machine, though most steps
are not parallelized so the process may be faster on more recent machines with
fewer cores.  About 300 GB of free space are required to store the raw,
intermediate, and reduced data products, though the final products are $<30$
GB, with an actual size depending on whether the baseline-subtracted versions
are kept separate from the original files.  The download process may take
substantially longer than the data reduction.
