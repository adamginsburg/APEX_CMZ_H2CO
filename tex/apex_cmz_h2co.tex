\section{Introduction}
The central region of our Galaxy, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), is the
nearest location in which we can study star formation in an `extreme'
environment with pressure, turbulent Mach number, 
and gas temperature much higher than in local star forming regions.  While
there have been great leaps in our understanding of star formation
from local molecular clouds in the past decade
\citep{Lada2012a,Heiderman2010a,Lada2010a}, there remain many unanswered
questions about how star formation changes as gas becomes denser, more opaque,
and more turbulent, as it most likely was in galaxies at the peak of cosmic
star formation \citep{Kruijssen2013a}.


The central $\sim100$ pc\footnote{Assuming the IAU-recommended $d=8.5$ kpc
\citep{Ghez2008a,Gillessen2009b,Reid2009a,Gillessen2013b}.} `ring' or `dust ridge'
\citep{Lis1994a,Sofue1995a,Molinari2011a} within our Galaxy's CMZ has attracted
a great deal of attention recently, as it has a much higher ratio of gas mass
to star formation tracers than the rest of the galaxy
\citep{Longmore2013a,Longmore2012b,Longmore2012a,Kruijssen2013a,Yusef-Zadeh2009a,Immer2012a}.
The star formation in this region appears to be suppressed relative to
expectations based on nearby star-forming regions and nearby (on a larger
scale) galactic disks
\citep{Kennicutt1998a,Kennicutt2012a,Leroy2013a,Heiderman2010a}.
\citet{Longmore2013a} recently proposed that the clouds along the ring
represent a time-ordered path from starless to star-forming clouds, from `The
Brick' (G0.253+0.016, cloud a) through the lettered dust ridge clouds
\citep[clouds b,c,d,e,f][]{Lis1999a}, ending at Sgr B2.

The thermal properties of this gas are a crucial component for understanding
the conditions governing both star formation and interstellar chemistry.  The
gas temperature sets the sound speed in the gas and therefore the Mach number
within a turbulent medium.  It also governs the thermal Jeans mass.  Whether
turbulence or gravity governs the fragmentation scale, the gas temperature is
clearly important.  For interstellar chemistry, the gas temperature determines
which species freeze out onto grains and therefore which can be readily
observed in the interstellar medium.

Prior gas temperature measurements primarily used the popular ammonia
metastable inversion transition thermometer \citep[\ammonia (1,1) -
(5,5);][]{Guesten1981a,Huettemeister1993a,Ott2014a}, which is sensitive to
moderate density gas \citep[$n(\hh) \sim 10^3-10^4$ \percc;][]{Shirley2015a}.
While this thermometer is generally reliable in cold regions, the population of
the higher energy states - those sensitive to temperatures $T\gtrsim60$ K - may
be affected by `formation heating', a mechanism recently discovered to affect
much of the CMZ gas in which the excess energy from molecule formation leaves a
significant fraction of the molecules in a rotationally excited state
\citep[][]{Mills2013a,Lis2014a}.  \citet{Ao2013a} used the para-formaldehyde
(\para) 220 GHz thermometer \citep{Mangum1993a}, which is sensitive to denser
($n\sim10^4-10^5$ \percc) and hotter ($T>20$ K, usually $T\sim60$ K) gas, to
map out the inner $\sim75$ pc of the CMZ and found high temperatures comparable
to those found in previous studies.

There is a long-standing problem that the observed gas and dust temperatures do
not agree throughout the CMZ
\citep{Guesten1981a,Molinari2011a,Ao2013a,Ott2014a}.  This discrepancy
represents a significant problem for understanding the importance of gas
temperature and pressure in the evolution of molecular clouds.  The dust
temperature is readily estimated via continuum mapping and therefore is often
used as a proxy for the gas temperature.  While the discrepancy is not
theoretically a problem, as the gas and dust may remain collisionally uncoupled
up to moderately high densities given a high enough heating rate, it is an
important empirical difference between CMZ and Galactic disk clouds.
Dust and \ammonia derived temperatures are usually assumed and often observed
to agree in Galactic clouds
\citep{Pillai2006a,Dunham2010a,Juvela2012a,Battersby2014a}, but the difference
can no longer be ignored in the Galactic center.

We have expanded the \formaldehyde mapping project of \citet{Ao2013a} to a
$\sim5\times$ larger area, including the dust ridge and the positive-longitude
turbulent clouds thought to be associated with the intersection point between
the x1 and x2 orbits \citep{Rodriguez-Fernandez2006b,Riquelme2013a}.  We
describe the new
observations in Section \ref{sec:observations}.  In Section \ref{sec:signal},
we describe the analysis process used to extract signal from the data cubes and
derive temperatures.  We discuss various implications of our data in Section
\ref{sec:discussion}.  In the appendices, we describe further details of the
data reduction process, provide additional tables, and provide the source code
for this project.


\section{Observations \& data reduction}
\label{sec:observations}

\subsection{Observations}
We observed the Central Molecular Zone from $-0.4\arcdeg < \ell < 1.6\arcdeg$
with the APEX-1 (SHFI) instrument \citep{Vassilev2008a} on the Atacama Pathfinder
Experiment (APEX) telescope \citep{Guesten2006b} using the eXtended bandwidth
Fast Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (XFFTS) backend \citep{Klein2012a}.  The observations were
performed in service mode, and were spread out over two years.  The time was
divided into 25 hours in June
2013, 75 hours in April-July 2014, and 50 hours in October 2014.  The time was
split between the ESO (E-093.C-0144A; 50h), MPIfR (M-091.F-0019 and
M-093.F-0009; 75h), and OSO (E-093.C-0144A; 25h) queues.

The 2013 observations were taken in $4\arcmin \times 4\arcmin$ patches, and the
frequency range covered was 217.5-220 GHz and 216-218.5 GHz in the two spectral
windows. Scans were performed along lines of constant RA and Dec.

The 2014 observing strategy was modified to use larger $8\arcmin \times
8\arcmin$ scans along lines of Galactic latitude and longitude.  The frequency
range was also shifted to cover windows over 217-219.5 and 218.4-220.9 GHz, thus
including the bright \thirteenco and \ceighteeno 2-1 lines.

 The detected lines were \para \threeohthree 218.22219 GHz, \para \threetwotwo
 218.47563 GHz, \para \threetwoone 218.76007 GHz, SiO 5-4 217.10498 GHz,
 \methanol \fourtwotwo 218.44005 GHz, OCS 18-17 218.90336 GHz, HC$_3$N 24-23
 218.32471 GHz, \ceighteeno 2-1 219.56036 GHz, and \thirteenco 2-1 220.39868
 GHz.  


The raw data were acquired with 32768 spectral channels in each window,
yielding 0.1 \kms resolution.  We expect to see no lines narrower than a few
\kms in the CMZ, particularly not with the relatively shallow observations we
have acquired.  We therefore downsampled the data by a factor of 8 to 0.8 \kms
resolution prior to resampling onto a 1 \kms grid to make the data more
manageable.  

Additionally, for the \para data, we incorporated the 41 hours of observations
using the older fast fourier transform spectrometer (FFTS) backend from
\citet{Ao2013a}.  These data covered 2 GHz of bandwidth, including all three of
the \para lines and SiO 5-4, but they did not cover the CO isotopologue lines.

The system temperature ranged from $120 < T_{sys} < 200$ K for the majority of
the observations, with a mean $T_{sys}=165$ K.  A small fraction (10\%) of
observations were in the range $200 < T_{sys} < 300$ K.  There were also a very
small number ($<1\%$) with much higher system temperatures ($300 < T_{sys} <
750$ K) that were flagged out (see Section \ref{sec:flagging}).

\subsection{Reduction}
\subsubsection{Calibration}
Calibration was performed at the telescope using the standard APEX calibration
tools
\footnote{See the observing manuals:
\url{www.apex-telescope.org/documents/public/APEX-MPI-MAN-0012.pdf}
\url{www.apex-telescope.org/documents/public/APEX-MPI-MAN-0013.pdf} }.
These yield flux-calibrated spectra at each position with appropriate pointing
information.  Typical flux calibration uncertainties are $\sim10\%$ and
pointing errors $\sigma\lesssim2$\arcsec. % Carlos de Breuck, privat comm

There was a significant calibration error discovered at the APEX telescope during
a large segment of the 2014 observing campaign
(\url{http://www.apex-telescope.org/heterodyne/shfi/calibration/calfactor/}).
The calibration errors were of order $\sim15-25\%$.  We corrected the data using
the correction factors suggested on the calibration page, but the remaining
calibration uncertainty is higher in this data, $\sim15\%$ total rather than
the usual $\sim10\%$.

\subsubsection{Flagging bad spectra}
\label{sec:flagging}
Spectra were removed if they showed excessive noise compared to the
theoretical expectation given the measured system temperature.  As in
\citet{Ao2013a}, the threshold was set to $1.5\times$ the theoretical noise,
i.e. $1.5 \sqrt{2} T_{sys} (\Delta\nu t_{exp})^{0.5}$, where $t_{exp}$ is the
exposure time (integration time) per spectrum in seconds and $\Delta\nu$ is the
channel width in Hz.  This approach resulted in $\sim0.2\%$ of the data being
removed.  

At the position of Sgr B2, the noise was significantly higher due to signal
from the continuum source.  We therefore disabled this flagging in a
$2.5\arcmin$ box around Sgr B2.
% This is surprising, as Christian pointed out: Sgr B2 should only be 3-4 K in the
% continuum
% In [35]: (120*u.Jy).to(u.K, u.brightness_temperature((30/2.35*u.arcsec)**2*np.pi*2, 220*u.GHz))
% Out[35]: <Quantity 3.3529547153047083 K>


% Removing these baselines by
% the usual technique of masking out the emitting spectral region and fitting a
% low-order polynomial to the surroundings is somewhat impractical in the
% Galactic Center, where baseline ripples are on comparable scales to the
% extremely wide spectral lines.

%This method was abandoned: it resulted in negative bowls
% We perform a scan-by-scan baseline subtraction as follows: 
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Compute the mean spectrum across the scan
%     \item Identify pixels $>1-\sigma$ above the mean spectrum to be ignored
%         when baseline fitting (this is a simple `line masking' process)
%     \item Fit a line to each spectral channel across the scan
%     \item Smooth the fitted line parameters with a gaussian with with
%         $\sigma=10$ channels, interpolating into the line-masked regions
%     \item Subtract the fitted baselines
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% We therefore adopted a principle component analysis (PCA) baseline removal
% approach in which the data were spectrally smoothed and downsampled by an
% additional factor of 25, for a characteristic frequency scale of 15 MHz.  The
% data had their means subtracted before PCA cleaning so that only time-variable
% baseline variation was removed.  The resulting data were decomposed into
% eigenspectra, of which the 3 most correlated components were then set to zero.
% These components visually match the baseline ripples, and due to the wide
% smoothing (20 \kms resolution), no line information is lost.  The selection of
% 3 components was determined empirically by examining the eigenspectra; a test
% removing the first 10 components showed no significant difference in the
% cleaning but did show signs of extracting large-scale correlated signal.

% {fig:eigenspectra}{0.5}{0}


\subsubsection{Mapmaking}
The maps were made by computing an output grid in Galactic coordinates with
7.2\arcsec pixels and adding each spectrum to the cube at the appropriate
pixel\footnote{We use the term `pixel' to refer to a square data element
projected on the sky with axes in Galactic coordinates.  The term `voxel' is
used to indicate a cubic data element, with two axes in galactic coordinates
and a third in frequency or velocity} location.  In order
to avoid empty pixels and maximize the signal-to-noise, the spectra were added
to the grid with a weight set from a gaussian with $FWHM=10\arcsec$, which
effectively smooths the output images from $FWHM\approx28\arcsec$ to
$\approx30\arcsec$.  See \citet{Mangum2007a} for more detail on the on-the-fly
mapping technique used here.  The spectra were averaged with inverse-variance
weighting.  The full weight equation is therefore:
\begin{equation}
    W_i = \exp\left(\frac{-\left((x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2\right)}{2\sigma_{pix}^2}\right)
          \frac{1}{\sigma_{rms}^2}
\end{equation}
where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the coordinate of the pointing in pixel space,
$\sigma_{pix}\approx10\arcsec/\sqrt{8\log{2}}/(7.2\arcsec \textrm{pix}^{-1})=1.38$,
and $\sigma_{rms}$ is the standard deviation measured along the spectrum in a
signal-free frequency region.


%\todo{To demonstrate the utility of the PCA subtraction approach described in Section
%\ref{sec:baseline}, we show maps of the \formaldehyde \threeohthree line before
%and after PCA subtraction.}

The position-position-velocity (PPV) cubes were created with units of
brightness temperature on the corrected antenna temperature scale ($T_A^*$).
The main beam efficiency is $\eta_{mb} = 0.75$ (gain $\sim39$
Jy/K)\footnote{\url{http://www.apex-telescope.org/telescope/efficiency/}}.
These values are noted in the FITS headers of the released data.

The maps achieved a depth of $\sigma=50-80$ mK in 1 \kms channels and
$FWHM=30\arcsec$ beams.  The noise is slightly lower (about 15\%) than expected
from the online APEX calculator because our noise measurements are made in
moderately smoothed maps.
%While Figure \ref{fig:noisestats} shows the
%generally good performance of SHFI-1 during our observations, our data are
%affected by significant baseline problems which tend to obscure signal.

\subsection{Baselining}
\label{sec:baseline}
The data showed significant baseline structure, leading to large-scale
correlated components in the resulting spectra.  The baselines were removed
after generating cubes over a velocity range $-150 < v_{LSR} < 150$ \kms by the
following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item identify bright PPV regions in the \para \threeohthree line using the
        technique described in Section \ref{sec:signal}
    \item mask the regions identified as \threeohthree-bright for each other 
        spectral line data cube
    \item fit a polynomial to the un-masked data
    \item subtract the fitted polynomial
\end{enumerate}
We used a 7th-order polynomial for this process because lower order baseline
removal left a significant and patterned residual.  A more detailed examination
of the baseline removal process is described in Appendix
\ref{sec:baselineappendix}.

\section{Signal extraction \& masking}
\label{sec:signal}
We use the method described partially in \citet{Ao2013a} and more thoroughly in
\citet{Dame2011b} to mask the data cubes at locations of significant signal in 
the brightest line. 
A noise map was created by computing the sample standard deviation over a
200 \kms range in which no signal was present.
We use the \para \threeohthree line to create the mask by
the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Smooth the data with a gaussian of width 2 pixels in each direction
        (spatial and spectral)
    \item Create an inclusive mask of all pixels with brightness $T_A >
        2\sigma$ in the smoothed map
    \item Grow the mask from the previous step by 1 pixel in each direction
        (this is known in image processing as binary dilation)
\end{enumerate}

The \para \threeohthree mask was then applied to the \threetwoone and
\threetwotwo cubes created with the same PPV gridding.  There is some overlap
between the \methanol \fourtwotwo line and the \para \threetwotwo line in PPV
space, so we shifted the \para \threeohthree mask to the velocity of the
\methanol line in the \para \threetwotwo cube and excluded those pixels expected
to contain \methanol emission.
However, inspection of the \threetwotwo cube revealed that significant chunks
of the \threetwotwo signal were excised by this masking, so all further
analysis excludes the \threetwotwo line.

Integrated intensity maps are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:integ303}a for the \threeohthree map masked with the above method
in and Figure \ref{fig:integ303}b for the \threetwoone map
using the mask created from the \threeohthree data.

{fig:integ303}{1}{9.5in}

\subsection{Ratio maps}
\label{sec:ratio}
We have created \Rone ratio maps as a first step toward building temperature
maps.  In general, a higher \Rone indicates a higher temperature, and therefore
the ratio maps are a good proxy for \emph{relative} temperature.  We display
four different varieties of ratio map in Figures \ref{fig:ratiomaps} and
\ref{fig:ratiomapssm}.

Figure \ref{fig:ratiomaps} shows maps produced by creating ratio cubes, in which
each voxel has the value $R_1=\Rone$, then averaging across velocity with
constant weight for each voxel in Figure \ref{fig:ratiomaps}a and with the weight
set by the \threeohthree brightness value in Figure \ref{fig:ratiomaps}b; the latter is
equivalent to the ratio of the moment 0 maps shown in Figure
\ref{fig:integ303}.  In both
cases, the mask described in Section \ref{sec:signal} was applied to the cubes
before averaging over velocity.



%We created two independent ratio maps, \threetwotwo/\threeohthree and
%\threetwoone/\threeohthree, so that the two ratios (which are expected to be
%nearly the same) can be used as a sanity check.  However, in many regions,
%especially those with the greatest signal, the \threetwotwo line is strongly
%affected by contamination from a \methanol line, so that ratio is not
%usable for integrated maps.  The \Rone maps are used for all further analysis.

Ratio maps are subject to dramatic uncertainties in the low signal-to-noise
regime, which is inevitably reached in some parts of the map.  The error
distribution on the ratio becomes non-Gaussian as signal approaches zero,
approaching a pathological Cauchy distribution in which the mean becomes
undefined.
We therefore limited our ratio measurements to regions with significance
$>5\sigma$ in the \threeohthree line and used that line as the denominator
in the ratio.  By using the brighter line as the denominator, we avoid
divide-by-zero numerical errors.

\subsection{Region extraction}
\label{sec:region}
In order to extract higher signal-to-noise measurements on selected regions, we
broke the data down into subsets using both a by-eye region selection drawing
regions using ds9 and a more systematic approach using a dendrogram-based clump
finding algorithm \citep[][\url{http://dendrograms.org/}]{Rosolowsky2008c}.
The dendrogram clump finding uses a watershed decomposition like other clump
finding methods, but it also extracts clumps at different brightness scales
(different heights in the watershed) and tracks how nested clumps are related
to each other.  Within a hierarchy of nested clumps, the brightest and smallest
is a `leaf' and all associated larger structures are `ancestors' (roots or
trunks and branches).  We refer to the clumps identified in this manner as
`dendrogram-extracted' clumps from here on.
Figures 1 and 3 in \citet{Rosolowsky2008c} give visual representations of this
hierarchy.

% dendro_temperature.py
% TODO: decide whether we used the full resolution or the smoothed version.
% Presently (Jan 5), we are using the smoothed version
% smooth We ran the dendrogram/clumpfind extraction analysis on the smoothed
% smooth \threeohthree cube data.  We assumed a uniform noise per pixel
% smooth $\sigma_{T}=\bar{\sigma_T}=0.02$ K.  We enforced thresholds of a minimum number of
% smooth voxels
% smooth $N_{min}=200$, 

We ran the dendrogram extraction analysis on the 
\threeohthree PPV cube data.  We assumed a uniform noise per pixel
$\sigma_{T}=\bar{\sigma_T}=0.07$ K, which corresponds to the mean noise
per field.  We enforced thresholds of a minimum number of
voxels $N_{min}=100$, a peak threshold of $I = 3\sigma$, and a splitting
threshold $\Delta = 2\sigma$, which defines how large the brightness difference
between
the peak pixel and an adjacent pixel must be in order to divide the clump into two
sources.  The exact values of these parameters are not particularly
important, as we are interested in general trends with size-scale and
galactocentric distance, but we caution against overinterpretation of the
resulting catalog as the number of sources and their size and distribution can
change dramatically with small changes in the selected parameters.  The number
and location of voxels included in the catalog is, however, relatively robust
against small parameter changes.

For each extracted blob, we measured the corresponding integrated and peak
emission in the \threeohthree, \threetwoone, and \thirteenco cubes.  We also extracted the mean
dust temperature and column density from SED fits to Herschel HiGal 170-500\um
maps \citep{Molinari2010a,Traficante2011a}.  The SED fits were performed on
background-subtracted data using an approach originally described in
\citet{Battersby2011a}, which includes details of the fitting process and
specification of assumed physical parameters.  We also extracted dust column
density and temperature using a more naive pixel-by-pixel approach with no
background subtraction
(\url{http://hi-gal-sed-fitter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/}) and found the two
to be consistent.

\subsubsection{Manual region extraction}
\label{sec:byeye}
The by-eye selected regions were extracted less systematically, instead
focusing on peaks in the \threeohthree or \threetwoone emission.  These
selections were made in two dimension rather than in the full PPV space.  We
included a series of large square $8\arcmin \times 8\arcmin$ `apertures'
corresponding to each observed field.  For each region extracted in this
fashion, we fit a 1-3 component model as described in Section
\ref{sec:linemodeling}, where each component consists of a 6-parameter
multi-gaussian model.  An example spectrum extracted from a small region around
``cloud c'' is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cloudcspec}.  The extracted regions are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:regions}.

wrapper of RADEX\footnote{\url{https://github.com/adamginsburg/pyradex}} and
collision rates retrieved from LAMDA \citep{Wiesenfeld2013a}.  We then
upsampled these grids by spline interpolating between grid points to acquire a
high-resolution ($T\times n \times N = 250\times100\times101$) grid covering
$10<T<350$ K, $10^{2.5} < n < 10^7$ \percc, and $10^{11} < N < 10^{15.1}$

We extracted spectra averaged over selected regions and fitted
a 6-parameter model to the full 218-219 GHz spectral range using
\texttt{pyspeckit} \citep{Ginsburg2011c}.  The fitted parameters are the
amplitude of the \formaldehyde \threeohthree line, the centroid
velocity\footnote{We assume the \methanol and \formaldehyde lines have the same
centroid velocity, and we find no counterexamples to that assumption within our
data.}, the line width ($\sigma$), the ratio $R_1 = \Rone$, the ratio $R_2 =
\Rtwo$, and the
amplitude of the \methanol \fourtwotwo line, where $S_\nu$ is the surface
brightness.  For these spectra, we performed a different baseline subtraction
to that described in Section
\ref{sec:baseline}.  We first fit the described 6-parameter model, then fit a
spline curve to the residual smoothed to a 50-channel (50 \kms) scale.  We then
re-fit the model to the data.  In all but the lowest signal-to-noise cases,
this approach resulted in consistent ratio measurements between the two fits
and with the other methods.  Figure \ref{fig:twospectra_hotcold} shows two
example spectra that exhibit significantly different ratios with the spline
baseline fit indicated.

For each extracted region (see Section \ref{sec:region}), we created $\chi^2$
grids over the modeled temperature-density-column density parameter space.  We
measured $\chi^2$ with five independent constraints: the line ratio $R_1$, the
\formaldehyde abundance, the total column density of \hh, a lower limit on the
\hh volume density, and an upper limit on the beam filling
factor\footnote{Where the model predicts a brightness temperature higher than
observed, we can invoke a low filling factor to explain the discrepancy.  If
the model predicts a brightness temperature too low,
we can rule it out.}.  We use the
line \emph{ratio} as the primary constraint rather than line brightnesses to
avoid uncertainties due to the filling factor of the emitting gas: even for
diffuse clouds, the filling factor of the emitting regions may be $ff<<1$ if
the emission is isolated to compact shocked regions, as expected if highly
supersonic $\mathcal{M}>10$ turbulence is energetically dominant in the clouds.
We use an abundance $N(\para)/N(\hh) = X(\para) =
10^{-9.08\pm1}$, allowing for a two order of magnitude variation in
the \formaldehyde abundance
\citep{Ginsburg2013a,Carey1998a,Wootten1978a,Mundy1987a}.  To constrain the
total column density, we use the Herschel dust maps (see Section
\ref{sec:region}) to derive an \hh column
density, which has a nominal $\sim2-3\times$ uncertainty\footnote{The
statistical uncertainty is much smaller than the systematic unknowns, including
the dust opacity per unit mass, the presence of multiple line-of-sight cloud
components, and the presence of multiple temperature components within any
given cloud.}.  We treat the error as $10\times$ (instead of $\sim2-3\times$)
to account for the additional uncertainty in the abundance of \para.  To
constrain the dust density, we assume the selected area has a mass given by the
Herschel dust-derived mass and a spherical volume, which sets a conservative
(but nonetheless highly constraining) lower limit on the volume density.

These constraints are shown projected onto the three planes of our fitted
parameter space in the multi-paneled Figures
\ref{fig:coltemconstraints}-\ref{fig:parsonbrightness}.  The fitted parameters
are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:parsonbrightness}.

While $R_2$ can, in some cases, provide significant constraints on various
parameters, we do not use it because of the ambiguity imposed by the overlap
with the \methanol \fourtwotwo line.

\subsection{Blob modeling}
\label{sec:dendromod}
We derived temperatures for each dendrogram catalog blob using the same
measured quantities as in Section \ref{sec:linemodeling} as constraints.  The
$\chi^2$ grid approach described in Section \ref{sec:linemodeling} was used to
extract the temperature and associated error.

We plot the derived temperature for all clumps against the measured line ratio
in Figure \ref{fig:ratiovstem}.  This figure includes both `leaves' and `ancestors'
from the dendrogram extraction.  The figure illustrates the effects of assuming
higher or lower density on the temperature. The lower density models are
excluded by the observed volume density lower limit (assuming spherical
geometry) from the dust.  Based on
the good agreement seen in this figure, we use an assumed density $n(\hh)=10^4$
\percc when a uniform assumed density is required in further analysis.

$R_1$ for three different assumed densities with a constant assumed abundance.

\subsection{Temperature maps}
\label{sec:formaldehydetemmap}
Using the relations shown in Figure \ref{fig:ratiovstem}, we converted the
ratio map shown in Figure \ref{fig:ratiomaps} to a temperature map in Figure
\ref{fig:temmap}a.  Because this map includes the full line-of-sight integrated
emission, there are many regions where multiple independent components are
being mixed.

%Figure \ref{fig:temmap}b shows a temperature map created by measuring the
%temperature in each clump from the dendrogram clump extraction based on the
%smoothed data cube and averaging over the velocity axis.  Because there are
%hierarchically nested clumps in the dendrogram-based clumpfind, and because
%there are genuinely independent clumps along common lines of sight, there is
%still overlap and confusion.  The nested clumps in the dendrogram can provide
%more than one temperature measurement per voxel; we therefore use the most
%compact clump's temperature measurement for each voxel.

%The two temperature maps broadly agree, but the dendrogram map is smoother and
%aesthetically superior.  The noisy edges of regions in Figure \ref{fig:temmap}a
%are unlikely to be real temperature features, so the dendrogram map is
%preferred.

These temperature maps do not have uniform reliability.  There is some spatial
variation in the noise, but the variation in the signal is much more important.
In regions where the peak signal is low, the reliability of these maps is
substantially reduced.  Figure \ref{fig:peaksn} shows the peak signal-to-noise
in both the unsmoothed and the smoothed maps to indicate where the temperature
measurements can be relied upon.  We have also applied a mask to both panels of
Figure \ref{fig:temmapnosmooth} to make the low-reliability regions blend into
the background by adding a foreground gray layer with opacity set by the
inverse S/N from Figure \ref{fig:peaksn}b.

The effective range of detected temperatures is $\approx40-150$ K. While lower
and higher temperatures appear in the map, those measurements should not be
trusted.  Below $T\lesssim40$ K, all temperature measurements in the map are
effectively upper limits, generally corresponding to $T\lesssim40$ K.  This
limit is due to a combination of sensitivity and excitation: below 40 K, the
\para lines are observed to be faint; the \threetwoone line is not detected.
In regions of high column density, we detect both lines, and in all of these
regions, we have measured high temperatures ($T>40$ K).  
Since $T\sim40$ K corresponds to $R_1\sim0.15$, a $5\sigma$ temperature
measurement would require $T_B(\threeohthree) = (5 \times 0.07 \mathrm{K}) /
0.15 = 2.33$ K\footnote{We can do a little better with spectral averaging,
perhaps as low as $T_B=1$ K for a 5 \kms, but such high brightness temperaturse
are still rare.}, and all regions detected with such high brightness
temperatures also turned out to have higher $R_1$ and therefore higher
temperature.
The higher measured temperatures
become lower limits above $\sim150$ K because the \para line ratio is
intrinsically insensitive to higher temperatures, as can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:parsonbrightness} (rightmost column), in which the modeled line
brightnesses are both nearly constant above $T\gtrsim150$ K.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
\subsection{Gas heating and thermal balance}
\label{sec:heating}
Following \citet{Ao2013a}, we examine the energy balance in the CMZ gas to
understand the temperatures we measure.  The two key processes they identified
are cosmic ray and turbulent dissipation heating.  We ignore all UV-driven
heating processes as we are interested in gas at high extinction.

We determine the expected gas kinetic temperature by assuming that the heating
and cooling processes are in equilibrium.  This is generally a good assumption,
as typical gas cooling rates via line or dust cooling around $T\sim100$ K and
$n\sim10^5\percc$ are $dT/dt \sim 10^{-20} \mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}\percc \sim 23
(n/10^5 \percc) K/kyr$ \citep[][and see below]{Goldsmith2001}.  The cooling timescale
is shorter than the timescales for any energy injection mechanisms that may
plausibly heat the gas.  The supernova rate is $<1$/kyr over the whole CMZ, and
supernova remnants have lifetimes that are not much longer, so the supernovae
are expected to contribute to a diffuse cosmic ray population rather than local
stochastic heating incidents.  Turbulence in these clouds is dynamically driven
on scales of 10-30 pc \citep{Kruijssen2015a}, with $\sim10$ Myr crossing times.
Assuming the turbulent dissipation scale is close to the sonic scale with a
sound speed $c_s = 0.76 (T/100\mathrm{K})^{1/2}$, the gas temperature will be
well mixed on milliparsec spatial scales on kiloyear timescales.


We expand upon the \citet{Ao2013a} analysis by solving for the temperature
assuming that both cosmic ray ionization and turbulent heating are present and
that the dust temperature is nonzero ($T_{dust}=30$ K except where specified
otherwise).  We have used the same cosmic ray heating rate
and turbulence heating rate from \citet[][their equations 12 and 18]{Ao2013a}
and the same parametrization of the gas and dust cooling rates (their equations
7 and 8).  The gas cooling equation is a parametrization from
\citet{Goldsmith2001a}, which is most appropriate for local dark clouds, but
checking against the cooling curves of \citet{Clark2013a}, we find that the
parametrization is consistent with their fiducial $1000 G_0$, 1000$\times$
local cosmic ray ionization simulation (though the dominant coolant has changed).
We solve these equations numerically to determine the resulting equilbrium
kinetic temperature; the code can be found in the file
\texttt{heating.py} in the associated repository.

A first key point is that we measure gas temperatures $T\sim60$ K in many
clouds everywhere throughout the CMZ.  Since cosmic rays have very high
penetration depths, we expect that cosmic ray heating is entirely uniform
everywhere within the CMZ, independent of column density.  If this uniformity
holds, then we can set an upper limit on the cosmic ray ionization rate,
$\zeta_{CR} \lesssim 10^{-14}$ \pers, since a higher rate would result in a
minimum gas temperature above what we have measured.  For a fiducial
measurement, we use $n=10^{4.5}$ \percc, $dv/dr=5$ \kms \perpc, $T_{dust}=25$
K, and $\zeta_{CR} = 10^{-14}$ \pers, which yields $T_{gas}=55$ K in the
absence of any other heating mechanisms.  A lower density $n=10^4$ \percc and
higher gradient $dv/dr=10$ \kms \perpc yield the same temperature if
$\zeta_{CR} = 3\ee{-14}$ \pers, which gives a more conservative upper limit.

The resulting curves for $T_K(\sigma_v)$ are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:temvsfwhm_regions}.  In the plotted curves, we have assumed a
turbulent driving scale $L=10$ pc, a gradient $dv/dr = 5$ \kms \perpc, and a
cosmic ray ionization rate (CRIR) $\zeta_{CR}=10^{-17}$ \pers, with exceptions
noted in the legend.

%If one instead imposes a Larson relationship, with $\sigma_V \propto \ell$, and
%adds the constraint that the clouds must be in pressure equilibrium
%TODO: as per diederik's request

We also have information on the linewidth, size scale, and density for each
individual region, albeit with great uncertainties on each.  We use these
measurements to predict the gas temperature if turbulence is the only source of
heating.  We use the effective radius ($r_{eff} = (A/\pi)^{1/2}$, where $A$ is
the source area) of the
selected sources as the length scale, the measured linewidth $\sigma_v$, the
measured dust temperature $T_{d}$, and we assume the velocity gradient $dv/dr =
\sigma_v / r_{eff}$.  Of these measurements, the linewidth $\sigma_v$ is
dominant in determining the predicted temperature and is the least uncertain;
the velocity gradients we derive by this approach are not obviously reasonable
but they only affect the temperature minimally, with a power of 1/3.  This
analysis is performed both for the hand-selected apertures, which have
arbitrary radii but well-measured linewidths, and the dendrogram leaf sources,
which have reasonably well-defined radii but somewhat poorly defined line
widths.

The results of the turbulence-predicted temperature analysis are shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:turbtem}, which plots our measured temperature against
the predicted temperature.  For the hand-extracted regions, there is no
strong trend in the data, but most data points can be explained by turbulent
heating alone, perhaps with cosmic rays setting a high floor temperature.
There are a few points with measured temperatures below the turbulence
prediction.  Some of these regions
%, e.g. the regions denoted ``CoolSpot'' and
%``WarmSpot'' in the catalog,
include at least one velocity component that seems
to be genuinely cool and broad.  A possible explanation for these
regions is that their linewidths are an indication of bulk motion rather than
turbulent motion, and therefore they may be good regions to examine as possible
expanding bubble edges, either supernova or \hii-region driven.

The dendrogram-extracted points cluster above the $T_{predicted} =
T_{measured}$ line, but not by very much.  Since dendrogram-extracted
sources are necessarily coherent in position-velocity space, they are less likely
than the hand-selected features (which were selected in position-position space)
to represent unassociated line-of-sight features, supporting the idea that the
hand-selected features are widened by non-turbulent motions.

Nearly all of the high signal-to-noise measurements in the dendrogram sources
are above $T>60$ K, with many reaching $\sim100$ K.  The median temperature
excess is $T_{measured}-T_{predicted} = 35$ K for sources that disagree.  This
excess cannot readily be accounted for by cosmic rays, since it persists at
high linewidths where the turbulent heating dominates the cosmic ray heating.
The gas could be heated by a stronger local stellar radiation field, i.e. by
local star formation, but if so, the dust should be similarly heated.
Local X-ray heating could account for the higher temperatures if the local
X-ray flux density is $\sim3$ orders of magnitude higher than the average,
which provides a plausible explanation for some of these regions \citep{Ao2013a}.
However, it seems unlikely that the majority of \formaldehyde-emitting regions
mark local X-ray interaction features.  

What else can explain the higher temperatures?  We have assumed that the
\formaldehyde temperatures are driven by gas heating at the mean turbulent
dissipation rate, $\Gamma_{turb} = n \mu m_H  \frac{1}{2}
\left(\sqrt{3}\sigma_v\right)^3 / L$.  \citet{Pan2009a} observe that this is a
robust assumption for their simulations, in which the density and the
turbulence dissipation rate are uncorrelated (their Figure 3).  This
decorrelation seems to rule out any possibility that local variations in the
dissipation rate drive the high observed temperatures.
% It is possible
% that the turbulence in CMZ clouds is not well-developed, and the hot dense gas
% is driven by large-scale shocks, e.g. \hii region and supernova bubble edges,
% cloud `collisions' on self-intersecting orbits, and cloud accretion.  

One other possibility is that the dendrogram source extraction approach has
led to an underestimate of the line width.  Because we have selected only the
leaf sources, we have artificially truncated the sources in both position and
velocity.  The branch and trunk sources are systematically to the right of the
leaf sources in Figure \ref{fig:turbtem} (though we do not show them to avoid
excessive crowding), supporting this idea.  

We may be able to further constrain the heating mechanisms using this same data
set if precise velocity structure information is obtained for the clouds,
combining the line fitting analysis of the hand-selected regions with the
systematic blob extraction of the dendrogram extraction.  This analysis is left
for a future work.

affected by significant baseline issues, and it is possible that the
temperature has been
underestimated as a result.

\subsection{Temperature variation with spatial scale or radius}
Photon-driven heating mechanisms are subject to attenuation, so clouds with
significant X-ray or UV heating may have heated shells and cool interiors.
Turbulent and cosmic ray heating experience no such effects, but they exhibit a
different dependence on gas density than the corresponding cooling mechanisms.
If the interstellar UV radiation or X-ray heating are important, we would
expect to find warmer cloud edges and cooler cloud interiors.  The same is true
if the clouds are centrally condensed, since dust cooling can dominate heating
processes at very high densities.  If clouds are internally heated by
gravitational collapse and star formation, the cloud interior should be warmer
than its exterior.  

We have therefore examined the radial profiles of temperature and velocity
dispersion for selected clouds.  We measured the ratio $R_1$ and the line width
as a function of aperture size by extracting progressively larger circular
apertures centered on the same point.  For each spectrum extracted, we have
fitted the 6-parameter model described in Section \ref{sec:linemodeling} to
derive the ratio and linewidth.

Different variations with scale are observed.  For example, around `The Brick',
the ratio decreases from $\sim0.55$ at the position $\ell=0.237\arcdeg$, $b=0.008$
within a single spectrum to $\sim0.33$ when averaged over a radius
$\sim70\arcsec$ (Figure \ref{fig:brickradial}a).  By contrast, Figure
\ref{fig:brickradial}b shows a highly turbulent example where the temperature
is lowest at the center and higher on larger scales.  
These observations seem to imply that two different heating mechanisms, one
internally driven (The Brick) and one external (G1.23-0.08), are active within
the CMZ.  These two objects are not meant to be representative of the whole
CMZ, though, and radial properties of clumps need to be studied in more detail
to draw firm conclusions about the heating processes.

\subsection{Difference between gas and dust temperatures}
Similar to the results of \citet{Ao2013a} for the inner $\sim75$ pc, we find
that the \para and dust temperatures are note the same anywhere within the
inner $R\lesssim200$ pc.  Figure \ref{fig:temvstem_regions} shows the fitted \para
temperature vs the fitted dust temperature from HiGal.  The majority of the
\formaldehyde data points are well above the $T_{dust}=T_{gas}$ line
independent of the method used to extract the temperature.  The few sources
that are consistent with $T_{dust}=T_{gas}$ represent an interesting subset
of potentially very cool clouds, though they all have low signal-to-noise
ratios in the present data set.  Overall, though, our data clearly indicate
that, on $\sim$pc scales in the CMZ, dust is a coolant and the gas and dust are
not in equilibrium.

%\citet{Clark2013a} modeled The Brick with a suite of hydrodynamic simulations
%and found that even for such a dense structure, the gas and dust temperature
%can be uncoupled if the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and cosmic ray
%ionization rate (CRIR) are $\sim1000\times$ their local values.  In their
%model, the ISRF determines the dust temperature while the CRIR determines the
%gas temperature.  Assuming their model still holds further from Sgr A, our
%observations of high gas temperatures imply that the CRIR must remain elevated

\subsection{Spatial variations in gas temperature}
There are significant spatial variations in the gas temperature.  The most
obvious is in and around the Sgr B2 complex, where very high gas temperatures
are measured.  High gas temperatures, $T\sim100-120$ K, were previously
measured in a ridge to the Galactic northeast of Sgr B2 N using \methylcyanide
\citep[][Figure 4b]{de-Vicente1997a}, which we now confirm, though our data
show $T\gtrsim150$ K.  \citet{Ott2014a} also showed relatively high \ammonia
temperatures in this hot ridge.
% The high temperatures in the Sgr B2 region, $T>80$ K, extend to a radius of
% $\sim10$ pc (5\arcmin), and nearly 30 pc (12.5\arcmin) in the
% northwest/southeast directions. 
The Brick, Sgr A, and the 50 \kms and 20 \kms clouds exhibit the
highest temperatures outside of Sgr B2, with $T>100$ K.  The western portion of the
CMZ, around G359.5, shows cooler temperatures $40 < T < 60$ K.  
Along the `dust ridge', the high-latitude portion is slightly warmer than the
low-latitude region; this difference is most evident when comparing The Brick
to the region just south of it and at $\ell=0.5\arcdeg$.

%A high temperature `ridge' follows along the
%positive-latitude component of the \citet{Molinari2011a} `ring', tracing
%through The Brick into the Sgr A complex.

% By contrast, lower temperatures, $T\sim60$ K, are observed in the
% negative-latitude component of the `ring'.  At positive longitudes,
% $\ell\gtrsim0.9\arcdeg$, there are many regions with $T\sim60$ K.  Similarly,
% most of the gas in the Sgr C complex is around 60 K.  Figure
% \ref{fig:temvslonplot} shows the derived temperatures for the dendrogram
% objects as a function of longitude to more directly illustrate this structure.

for some of the Sgr B2 regions are shown as red upward-pointing triangles near
the top of the plot.}

Figure \ref{fig:kdlorbit} shows the orbital fit from \citet{Kruijssen2015a} and
a position-velocity slice through the fitted temperature cube following that
orbit.  The fit is imperfect, especially along the green segment, but still very useful
for tracking the properties of clouds in common environments.  Intriguingly,
the `far-side' clouds (green segment, 1 Myr < $t$ < 2 Myr), are cooler than
many of those on the near side, such as The Brick (red segment).  

%Perhaps the most interesting feature of the orbital extraction is the qualitative
%difference between the `big clouds', Sgr B2, Sgr A, and The Brick, and the rest
%of the gas.  At least in terms of gas temperature, The Brick is in the same class
%as the massive star-forming Sgr B2 complex and the clouds closest to the central
%black hole.

We assign a time to each dendrogram-extracted clump within 35 \kms and 6 pc of
the \citet{Kruijssen2015a} orbit and plot their temperatures against that time
in Figure \ref{fig:kdltemvstime}.  The possible linear increase in temperature
over the first $\sim0.5$ Myr might support the \citet{Kruijssen2015a}
hypothesis that the `ring' represents a single gas stream on its first passage
by Sgr A*.  However, the `trend' is equally consistent with a constant
temperature over the same range.
%The cooler gas on the far side does not obviously fit into this picture, 
%and we suggest in Section \ref{sec:coolstream} that it is not affiliated with
%the orbit (but the existence of such a cool stream does \emph{not} challenge
%the model directly).

\subsection{Comparison to \citet{Ott2014a} \ammonia temperature map}
\label{sec:ammoniacompare}
\citet{Ott2014a} measured the \ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) lines over a subset of the
region we mapped, from $-0.2\arcdeg < \ell < 0.8\arcdeg$.  These two lines are
a frequently
used thermometer sensitive to gas temperatures $5 \lesssim T \lesssim 40$ K,
with weak sensitivity up to $\sim80$ K \citep[][Figure 1]{Mangum2013a}.  The
\ammonia lines also have lower critical densities by about an order of
magnitude, $n_{crit}(\textrm{\ammonia}~(1,1))\sim10^3$ \percc while $n_{crit}(\para~
\threeohthree)\sim10^4$ \percc \citep[Figure
\ref{fig:nh3vsh2co};][]{Shirley2015a}.  The temperatures derived from the
\ammonia line ratio are lower by construction than those we have
measured.  Nonetheless, we compare our temperature map to that of
\citet{Ott2014a} to look for common trends and significant differences.

{Model of the \ammonia and \para line excitation temperature $T_{ex}$ as a function

temperatures in lower-density gas.}
{fig:nh3vsh2co}{0.25}{0}

Figure \ref{fig:nh3tmap} shows the \citet{Ott2014a} temperature map in the same
color scheme that we have used in Figure \ref{fig:temmapnosmooth}.  There are some
trends that are common between the two maps: the Sgr A complex and Sgr B2
complex are the warmest regions, the `diffuse' gas surrounding these is
somewhat cooler, and the positive latitude component of the
\citet{Molinari2011a} `ring' is slightly warmer than the negative latitude
component.

The most significant difference occurs in the southwest portion of the Sgr B2
cloud.  In this region, the \ammonia temperature ranges from the high ($T>80K$)
temperatures of the Sgr B2 N hot ridge into a cooler background $T\sim30-40$ K.
By contrast, the \formaldehyde temperatures stay high, indicating gas
temperatures $T>150$ K extending to the southwest of Sgr B2 S.  This difference
probably indicates that there is a cool, diffuse component being detected in
\ammonia, while \formaldehyde is detecting a hotter, denser component.  This
region will provide a good comparison target for other thermometric
observations.

\subsection{Comparison to other measurements with \para}
\label{sec:h2cocompare}
The largest survey of \para temperatures prior to this work was by
\citet{Ao2013a}, who observed the inner 75 pc.  They performed a similar
analysis to ours but over a smaller area.  They reported similar temperatures,
with some small differences due to a different set of collision rates adopted
(we used \citet{Wiesenfeld2013a}, they used \citet{Green1991a}).  The \citet{Ao2013a}
survey found uniformly high temperatures within the bright Sgr A cloud complex.
Our survey finds a greater variety in gas temperatures due to the larger area
covered.

There have also been observations of \para temperatures with interferometers.
\citet{Johnston2014a} noted a very high temperature peak, $T>320$ K, using these
lines of \para toward The Brick, G0.253+0.015.  We measure similar line
ratios toward The Brick, but on larger scales.  The interpretation of these
line ratios is subject to some question, though.  Above 300K, the collision
rates provided by LAMDA \citep{Green1991a,Schoier2005a,Wiesenfeld2013a} must be
extrapolated.  Additionally, very high $R_1$ values cannot be
reproduced by high temperatures with the current suite of collision rates, but
instead require that the lines be optically thick and thermalized and therefore
at very high densities.   Given the low brightness temperatures observed, if
the emission is optically thick, it must be coming from an extremely small
area, which is inconsistent with the observed large extent of the emission
unless it is also extremely patchy.  That remains a possibility if we are
observing massive, dense clouds with relatively uniform turbulent properties,
though it is unlikely - we discuss this further in Section
\ref{sec:thickorwarm}.  We conclude, therefore, that a lower limit on the
gas temperature in The Brick, $T\gtrsim120$ K, is consistent with our observations.



%\subsection{Radial Variations}
%There are many reasons to expect that gas temperature will increase as gas
%falls toward the Galactic center.  As it falls further in on an elliptical but
%unclosed orbit, the gas is subject to much greater shear near pericenter,
%driving stronger turbulence.  The stellar density increases, implying a
%stronger radiation field.  There may be a
%greater density of young stars, which in turn would imply more supernovae and a
%greater cosmic ray density.  The density of X-ray emitting sources (e.g.,
%stellar remnants) also increases, providing yet another source of heating.
%Finally, the central black hole, while inactive now, may have gone through
%previous bursts of activity, driving brief but powerful waves of X-ray heating.
%Independent of the mechanism, though, there is reason to expect some radial
%variation in temperature.
%
%Figure \ref{fig:temvsrad} shows the latitude-averaged temperature as a
%function of projected radius.  While there is no clear radial trend, there are
%important features: the majority of the gas at $R>0.9\arcdeg$ (130 pc) is below
%$T\lesssim 60$ K, while within $R<0.9\arcdeg$ the majority of the gas is
%between 70 and 120 K (with many lower limits in Sgr B2).  There are hints that
%the cooler gas that is observed in this range may actually be at larger
%galactocentric radii and simply be projected onto the $R=0$ region.

%In the unsmoothed data, there is nothing to see.  I can't convince myself that
%there was ever truly a cool component.  I think it came from the dendrogram
%sources.
% \subsection{A stream of fresh gas falling into the CMZ?}
% \label{sec:coolstream}
% Accretion onto the CMZ from larger scales via the X1 and X2 orbits has
% previously been inferred from $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios.  We have looked for
% features that may correspond to further accretion, transfering gas from
% $R\sim1$ kpc to $R\sim100$ pc.
% 
% The gas streamer extending from $\ell=0.2\arcdeg$ to $\ell=1.3\arcdeg$ (Figure
% \ref{fig:coolstream}) may represent such a stream of infalling gas.  The lack of
% IRDC features in the Spitzer 8 \um data corresponding to this stream within
% $R<R_{SgrB2}$ restricts it to be on the far side of the CMZ.  Since it does not
% align closely with the \citet{Kruijssen2015a} orbit, this stream is probably
% not following the same path as the Brick, the lettered clouds, and Sgr B2.
% The large observed linewidths imply that the stream is genuinely associated
% with the CMZ, though its distance from Sgr A may be much larger than its
% projected distance.  The path we have traced through Figure \ref{fig:coolstream}
% has been selected by eye and is not physically motivated (e.g., by a predicted
% orbit) but it can be observed as an apparently coherent stream in the \thirteenco
% data cubes as well.    Gas in this stream is moderately cooler than its
% surroundings and the positive-latitude molecular ring clouds.  The stream does
% not appear to be actively star-forming at present, most likely because the gas
% is at a lower average density.
% % yet it contributes to the total cold gas mass
% % inferred in the inner galaxy.  However, the total mass within the inner
% % projected 200 pc is still dominated by the `ring' clouds and Sgr B2, so at
% % least some deficit remains.

\subsection{Is the gas warm or just optically thick?}
\label{sec:thickorwarm}
As noted in Section \ref{sec:h2cocompare}, there is degeneracy in the modeling
that allows the observed ratios to be produced by very dense gas in addition to
hot gas.  Indeed, ratios approaching $R_1=1$ occur for relatively low
temperatures ($T\sim30$ K) at very high densities ($n>10^{6}$ \percc)
and very high column densities ($N(\para)>10^{16}$ \perkms \persc) because
the lines become optically thick and have LTE temperatures.

Since the mean densities at 30\arcsec resolution are always significantly lower
($n\lesssim\mathrm{few}\ee{5}$ \percc), such high density,
optically thick gas would have to have a very low filling factor.  The peak
\para \threeohthree brightness ranged from $0.2 \lesssim T_{mb} \lesssim 2$ K
in the detected regions, implying upper limits on the filling factor 1-7\% if
we assume the resolved brightness temperature equals the dust temperature,
$T_B=T_{dust}$.
In practice, the filling factor would have to be lower still, since any
optically thin \para in surrounding lower-density gas would favor the
\threeohthree line and contribute to a lower \Rone.

The strongest argument against such a scenario is the extremely high column
density required.  At typical \para abundances $X\sim10^{-9}$, or even more
extreme abundances $X\sim10^{-8}$, the implied local column density is
$N(\hh)\gtrsim10^{25(24)}$ in a single velocity bin.  Column densities up to
$N(\hh)\sim10^{24}$ \persc are observed, but with much lower filling fractions
$ff\sim10^{-4}$, in The Brick \citep[][their Figure 4]{Rathborne2014a}.  Even
in The Brick, the densest cloud besides Sgr B2, higher column densities are not
observed.  So, while it remains possible that optically thick \para is
responsible for the observed line ratios, it is very unlikely, especially
outside the densest clouds.

One remaining possibility is that the \para lines become optically thick
because of dramatically reduced turbulent line spreading and therefore
increased line trapping.  Such an effect would require a transition from
supersonically turbulent to coherent (subsonically turbulent) gas motion
\citep[e.g.][]{Pineda2010a} and could reduce the required column densities by
$\sim100\times$.  Still, the fact that we observe \para emission spread over a
wide range of velocities renders this scenario unlikely, since it would require
many high-column-density, coherent clumps moving at high velocity with respect
to one another.


\subsection{The CMZ average}
For comparison to extragalactic observations, we have included a spectrum
averaged over the whole $\sim300$ pc extent of our survey in Figure
\ref{fig:wholecmzspec}.  The peak amplitude is 50-60 mK and the measured
line ratio $\Rone = 0.25$, corresponding to a temperature $T=64$ K at $n=10^4$
\percc or $T=48$ K at $n=10^5$ \percc.  
Over the same area, the measured mean dust temperature from HiGal is 23 K,
though on such large scales it would be more appropriate to use Planck or WMAP
data to perform this measurement.
The spectral fit is imperfect, showing a non-flat baseline between the
\threetwoone and \threetwotwo lines, but nonetheless the extracted value is
likely representative of the CMZ-wide average.  This temperature is very close
to the \ammonia-measured temperature in M83 \citep[56 K;][]{Mangum2013a}, which
has a similarly low dust temperature $T_{dust,M83} = 31$ K over a 600 pc
region.  Maffei 2, NGC 1365, and NGC 6946 also exhibit similar gas and dust
temperatures to our Galactic center in the \citet{Mangum2013a} sample,
suggesting that these galaxies all have analogous gas thermal structures in
their inner regions.  The other galaxies in that sample, especially the
starburst galaxies, have significantly warmer gas and dust, with temperatures
closer to those measured for Sgr B2 than for the whole CMZ.

{fig:wholecmzspec}{0.5}{0}

% However, it is still possible
% to distinguish cosmic ray and turbulent heating if one dominates over the
% other: turbulent heating depends strongly on the velocity dispersion ($\Gamma
% \propto \sigma_V^3$), while CR heating should have no dependence on the
% velocity dispersion.  Additionally, turbulence has a scale dependence, since
% the global dynamics (rotation) dominates over turbulence on scales larger than
% the scale height in the CMZ: $h\sim10$ pc (4\arcmin) in the 100-pc `ring',
% $h\sim50$ pc (20\arcmin) in the $\ell=1.3\arcdeg$ cloud \citep{Kruijssen2013a}.
% I'm not sure this really makes sense.  Is it even possible to measure the gas
% temperature on larger physical/angular scales?

% These differences result in testable predictions.  If turbulence is the
% dominant heating mechanism in the CMZ clouds, there should be a correlation
% between the observed line width and the gas kinetic temperature.

% \todo{This is speculative.}  In a highly turbulent medium, most of the power
% dissipation happens on the smallest size scale (if $L > \sigma_v^3$).  If the
% cooling rate is enhanced in the postshock medium, the high gas temperature will
% be isolated to high-density, compact clumps, but these clumps will also
% dominate the line emission.  \todo{This should result in a density dependence
% of the temperature or observed temperature $T(n) > n^1$, maybe $T(n) \sim n^2$ ?}
% Cosmic rays should not exhibit this behavior; they should heat all scales equally
% and care only about the \emph{mean} density.

%\subsection{Shocks}
%Assuming the dust temperature reflects the mean gas temperature and only a subset
%of the gas has been heated to the high observed temperatures, we can determine the
%shock velocity required to supply the heating.  Assuming an adiabatic strong shock,
%$T_{ps} = \frac{3}{16}\frac{\mu v_s^2}{k}$, where $\mu = \mu_{\hh} = 2.8$.  A 1 \kms
%strong shock can produce a postshock temperature of 65 K.  With observed linewidths 

%\section{Examination of Individual Spectra}
%%\todo{The modeling is ambiguous still: it is necessary to impose some sort of
%%restriction on the abundance or column density in order to acquire reasonable
%%constraints on the temperature.}
%In order to maximize the signal-to-noise and acquire the strongest constraint
%on the temperature, we extract spectra for regions with bright lines.  This
%approach is similar to the approach adopted in \citet{Ao2013a}, but for a much
%larger area.
%
%\subsection{Sources in the Ring}
%
%\subsubsection{The Brick: G0.253+0.016}
%We examine two lines of sight through The Brick, in the northeast at
%G0.241+0.006 and in the southwest at G0.261+0.028.  The northeast line of sight
%has two independent velocity components with dramatically different
%temperatures: a 30 \kms component with only a lower limit on temperature,
%$T>300$ K, and a 0 \kms component with $T=73\pm3$ K.  The southwest line of
%sight has only one component with $T=157\pm10$ K.
%
%\subsubsection{Cloud d: G0.38+0.04}
%Cloud ``d'' is one of the possible protoclusters identified in

%
%\subsection{Clouds e/f: G0.47+0.01}
%Clouds ``e'' and ``f'' together make another proto-cluster in

%$T=110\pm20$ K.  However, because of the region of parameter space the lines
%allow, the density is reasonably constrained to be $n(\hh)\sim10^{4\pm0.2}$ \percc,
%much lower than in cloud d and more comparable to The Brick.

\section{Conclusion}
We present the largest gas temperature map of the CMZ to date.  There is warm
($T\gtrsim60$ K) gas pervading the CMZ out to a radius $\sim200$ pc.  However,
there is also significant contrast in gas temperature, with massive clouds such
as The Brick, Sgr B2, and the Sgr A cloud complex exhibiting temperatures in
excess of $T>100$ K.

The high gas temperatures throughout the CMZ suggest that turbulent heating is
dominant in many locations.  Cosmic rays may dominate in less turbulent
sub-regions within the CMZ, but we are able to place an upper limit $\zeta_{CR}
< 10^{-14}$ \pers because a higher CRIR would result in a higher floor
temperature for our observations.  In some areas, though, turbulent plus cosmic
ray heating are inadequate to explain the observed temperatures, suggesting
additional mechanisms are involved in some clouds.

Our new observations are broadly consistent with the orbital model described by
\citet{Kruijssen2015a}.  While there are some individual discrepancies, it at
least appears that the near-side clouds (The Brick and the lettered clouds on
the path to Sgr B2) have consistent thermal properties and fall along a stream
of progressively increasing temperature as a function of age along the
predicted orbits.  

% The 80 \kms cloud stream extending from $\ell=1.2\arcdeg$ to $\ell=0.3\arcdeg$
% is relatively cool compared to the rest of the CMZ despite its broad line
% width.  The lower temperature hints that it is more distant from pericenter
% than the `ring' clouds, and it may therefore represent a fresh stream of gas
% infalling into the center.

\section{Baseline removal}
\label{sec:baselineappendix}
The baselines in our SHFI-1 data were particularly problematic, more than is
usual in modern heterodyne obervations.  The 218 GHz window we have observed is
particularly sensitive to resonances within the SHFI-1 receiver that vary on
$<1$ minute timescales; our off-position calibrations were performed about once
per minute and therefore were not rapid enough to mitigate this problem
completely.  The baselines can broadly be described as smoothly varying ripples
on the scale of $\sim1/10$ the spectral window, plus more rapidly varying
ripples on 20-40 \kms scales.  In principle, this is a straightforward problem
of identifying the fourier components associated with each of these scales and
subtracting them.

In practice, we discovered that it was not possible to remove the dominant
baseline structure on either scale without significantly affecting the
underlying spectral data.  We simulated a variety of fourier-space suppression
approaches by adding synthetic signal to baseline spectra extracted from the
first few PCA components of the real spectra.
The PCA extraction approach is able to pull out the dominant baseline
components very effectively, but it inevitably includes significant signal in
the top few most correlated components, especially for the strong \formaldehyde
and \thirteenco lines.  We therefore abandoned it for the final data reduction.

For reference, we show an example spectrum that we believe to consist entirely
of baseline ripples in Figure \ref{fig:badbaselines}.

\Figure{figures/worst_baselines_map001_withsynth}
{An example showing some of the worst baselines observed.  The plotted spectrum
is from an observation on April 2, 2014, showing the average of the 5\% worst
spectra.  The blue curve shows a $\sigma=5$ \kms (FWHM$=11.75$ \kms) line centered
at the 0 \kms position of \para \threeohthree,
illustrating that the baseline `ripples' have widths comparable to the observed
lines.  While we selected the worst 5\% in this case, nearly all spectra are
affected by these sorts of baselines, and the shape and amplitude varies
dramatically and unpredictably.  The variation, unpredictable though it is,
works in our favor as it averages out over multiple independent observations.
The 218 GHz region shown here is also the worst-affected; the 220 GHz range
that includes the \thirteenco lines generally exhibits smoother and
lower-amplitude baseline spectra.}

% \section{Ratio examination of individual regions}
% \todo{While figures have been made for this, they will not be included unless
% necessary.}
% To further examine the reliability of the ratio determination, we have examined
% individual regions in the unsmoothed images on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using
% \texttt{pyspeckit} to fit a 4-parameter model (amplitude, centroid, width, and
% $R_1$) to each spectrum with constrained velocity range and width.  These fits
% were performed on the locally baseline-subtracted data cubes.

\section{Spectral fits for regions and apertures}
%\todo{This section is intended to be electronic-only.}
We provide a catalog of line ratios measured from aperture-extracted spectra
along with figures showing the best fit model for each spectrum.  We have
extracted spectra in regions with significant \para emission and in commonly
studied individual regions.  This catalog is intended to provide archival value
from our data set and enable future studies of individual regions.

In the attached electronic table, three types of region are included: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Circular regions-of-interest (Figure \ref{fig:regions}a)
    \item Rectangular regions-of-interest (Figure \ref{fig:regions}b)
    \item $8\arcmin \times 8\arcmin$ square observation fields (Figure \ref{fig:regions}c)
\end{enumerate}
The fit tables include multicomponent spectral fits with and without
spline-based baseline removal (see Section \ref{sec:linemodeling}).
Spatial parameters for the box (\texttt{GLON}, \texttt{GLAT},
\texttt{boxheight}, and \texttt{boxwidth}) or circle (\texttt{GLON},
\texttt{GLAT}, and \texttt{radius}) regions are included.  The average dust
column and dust temperature are reported (\texttt{higaldusttem} and
\texttt{higalcolumndens}).  The best fit parameters for gas temperature, \para
column, and \hh density are included along with their $\pm1-\sigma$ marginalized
limits.  The full column description is in the \texttt{tables/README.rst} file
in the source code repository, along with the tables in IPAC format.

The dendrogram property table is also included in the repository and described
in the README.

\section{Source code and data release}
The reduced and raw data are made available via the CfA dataverse
(doi:10.7910/DVN/27601).

The source code for this project in its entirety is available in the attached
tar file and on the internet at
\url{https://github.com/adamginsburg/APEX_CMZ_H2CO}.
Because the archives are public, we include scripts to download and process the
raw data so that all steps of the analysis performed here can be performed by
any individual with access to a computer.  Most of the data sets can be retrieved
in an automated fashion using an \texttt{astroquery}-based script from the ESO archive,
but some of the data is not stored in the archive and must be retrieved manually from the
\texttt{dataverse} servers. The total data reduction process
takes $\sim30$ hours on a 48-core, 2012-era linux machine, though most steps
are not parallelized so the process may be faster on more recent machines with
fewer cores.  About 300 GB of free space are required to store the raw,
intermediate, and reduced data products, though the final products are $<30$
GB, with an actual size depending on whether the baseline-subtracted versions
are kept separate from the original files.  The download process may take
substantially longer than the data reduction.


\section{A detailed example showing parameter constraints}
In Section \ref{sec:linemodeling}, we discussed the fitting approach used
to determine a best-fit temperature and uncertainties on that temperature.
Here, we go through a detailed example showing projections of the full 3D
temperature-density-column parameter space we explored and the constraints
each measurement places in each phase space.

the same color

space.

\section{Smoothed maps}
In many regions, signal was detected over large areas though the peak
signal-to-noise ratio remained low.  In this Appendix, we display smoothed
versions of many of the main figures in the paper to provide a record of
features that were weakly detected.  The smoothed maps may also give a sense
of how the temperature varies with spatial scale.

The cubes were smoothed in the spatial dimensions with a
$\sigma_{FWHM}=33.84\arcsec$ gaussian to achieve a resolution 45\arcsec and
$\sigma_{v, FWHM} = 3$ \kms in the spectral direction.  The smoothed cubes were
also downsampled by a factor of 2 in the spectral direction (the smoothing and
downsampling are independent).  
The same signal extraction analysis described in Section \ref{sec:signal} was used with a
threshold $T_A > 3\sigma$.

\subsection{Dendrogram cubes}

The dendrogram-extracted catalog was used to build a temperature PPV data cube
for visualization purposes.  Each voxel was assigned a value corresponding to
the temperature in the smallest dendrogram structure it was included in.  For
example, a voxel corresponding to a leaf has the temperature measured for that
leaf, while a voxel that is not in a leaf but is part of a structure would be
assigned the temperature of the \emph{smallest} structure in which it is
included.  The rest of the
cube was assigned NAN values.  This cube is similar to a smoothed cube, but
smoothed over connected structures rather than with a symmetric beam.  The cube
is interesting for visualization purposes, but should be treated with some
skepticism: structures that are connected in PPV space in the \threeohthree
line do not generally have the same, constant temperature, but they are forced
by construction to have the same temperature in this cube.  Despite this
caveat, comparison of the dendrogram figures (Figure \ref{fig:dendrotemmap}) to
the directly averaged figures (Figures \ref{fig:temmap} and
\ref{fig:temmapnosmooth}) shows that the dendrogram objects are effectively
averages over the included area in most cases.  Since there is less noise in
these figures, it is easier to identify interesting features in them by eye.
