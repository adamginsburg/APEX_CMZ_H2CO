This is a continuation of Project 093.C-0144(A) and should be continued under
that project code.  The observing scripts used for that program can be used,
though the tuning center should be changed to 218.9 GHz and off positions
should be scheduled more often (see below).

Observations are 8x8' OTF maps with off-positions scheduled every 2 minutes (4
scans).  The observing script describes 2 OTF maps observed with perpendicular
scans to minimize cross-hatching.  

The scans are oriented in Galactic coordinates.  There are three off positions
selected to exclude CO emission.  13CO should be detected at all or nearly all
positions, though at varying velocities.  The tuning center is 218.9 GHz
to include the 13CO 2-1 line (220.399) and the SiO 5-4 line (217.105)
simultaneously.  We avoid 219 GHz because that places the 12CO line in the USB
at 134 km/s relative to the C18O line and creates overlap; the extra 100 MHz gives
us an extra ~300 km/s of buffer.

The targets for this run should include the following top-priority targets:

Map_118
Map_123
Map_124
Map_031
Map_032
Map_055
Map_115
Map_116

and the following should be observed if the first 8 are completed:

Map_122
Map_019
Map_021
Map_056
Map_010
Map_013
