Each field should be observed 4x to achieve the target noise of 0.04 K RMS in a 3 km/s channel.

Observations are 8x8' OTF maps with off-positions scheduled every 7 minutes (15
scans).  The observing script describes 2 OTF maps observed with perpendicular
scans to minimize cross-hatching.  Two sets of these two perpendicular scans
should be required to reach the target noise (4 OTF maps total, 2 in each
direction, or 2 runs of the script).

The scans are oriented in Galactic coordinates.  There are three off positions
selected to exclude CO emission.  13CO should be detected at all or nearly all
positions, though at varying velocities.  The tuning center is exactly 219 GHz
to include the 13CO 2-1 line (220.399) and the SiO 5-4 line (217.105)
simultaneously.

The priority order is given in the observing scripts, but is reproduced here as well:

SUMMARY:
OTF mapping of the entire CMZ.  Each field should be observed with 4 OTF
macros.  One of three different off positions is specified for each field in
the observing script.
